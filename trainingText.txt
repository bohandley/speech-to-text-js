you listen i i had actually i brought that up in the intro about how i know you listen the stuff because youre always asking me questions about stuff that i say or other people say or whatever goes on and i think thats you know its a good way to learn you know tim yeah yeah absolutely if if youre not the not listening to stuff if youre not trying to forward uh you�re learning and your information and your business partnerships everything like that youre youre moving backwards joe yep tim so absolutely every every little bit helps joe cool so i know you i know you got your start technically a ways back i know youre flipping down in aurora at one point tim yup joe and you kind of put that on hiatus and focus on your your general contracting business why don�t why don�t we just kind of give a little history of what youre all about i mean i know i know the story but nobody else does so let�s lets kind of dive in for a few minutes tim yeah joe about who you are and how it all got started tim okay um my business actually started as a partnership with my best friend back in i believe it was ninety nine or two thousand we essentially started a company that serviced uh foreclosure properties for one specific broker out of schaumburg and um essentially we started doing like foreclosure cleanouts all the things necessary for bank servicing rekeys winterization gas cuts and so forth um we started servicing that one broker and eventually uhm which i dont recommend anybody as far as with your best friends or anything like that is partnering with them thats thats not the greatest idea joe right tim um you hear all the horror stories about that eventually we split ways i created my own tmj asset back in two thousand one and essentially started servicing brokers um i took on a second part of my business which im a strong believer in im not keeping all your eggs in one basket um basically its a foreclosure inspection company that the banks require any time the property goes into foreclosure foreclosure bankruptcy and so forth those properties need to be um checked on because if a property were to go vacant you know in the middle of winter theres going to be damage to the property it�s the its the banks responsibility to maintain those properties and to maintain those values of those properties joe right joe so the banks essentially needed all these contractors during you know during the downturn there that uh that service these vacant houses and essentially at one point we were doing thirty five hundred uh vacancy inspections and and bankruptcy inspections and so forth per month um and i had a huge crew of guys doing that um after that started to downturn which its its so going the company still going still doing foreclosures um still servicing brokers in the local area clears throat essentially uh once that started to downturn basically i went back into construction that was right around two thousand eight when all the property values were super high um i had a lead on a property in aurora that i really really couldnt pass up so i basically i beg borrow and steeled to ah to purchase the property and flip it that property was basically that was essentially my first personal um endeavor is into real estate investing and so forth which it did fairly well joe let well before you get too far let�s talk about it what year was this? joe this was two thousand well actually i brought it in the late two thousand six joe okay tim is when i when i bought the property crosstalk joe right before the crash tim and then i sole it in two thousand eight joe right yeah right before the crash so property values were maxed out i bought the property super cheap it was it was almost a wholesale deal um the guy the listings had just expired i went and looked at the property even though it it just expired and the guy was in foreclosure he was ready to lose the property and uh basically i made him an offer and he accepted and we kind of did it through my realtor that was showing me the property um so my realtor kind of double into the deal at that time because the listing expired joe right tim so it was almost a almost a wholesale deal i i wrote the contract myself that time joe okay tim um and so forth but uh yeah that property i bought it i believe it was one ninety it was on a acre unincorporated aurora dupage county in illinois joe okay tim i know there are other people that are listening joe sure tim and essentially it was a really niche um market there there�s houses literally right across the street that were incorporated in aurora that were selling at like six hundred at the time literally like the inaudible these houses so this property had a lot of potential is it it was really run down but the size of the property was a twenty seven hundred square foot ranch three bedroom two and a half bath and um the property was really run down it had like a flat roof on the back that witch and you know you always talk about how if you could if you could go back and do it again with people um on your podcasts theres a lot of things that i would have done differently this property i basically built to to satisfy my own personal tastes joe ah tim which is which in turn i spent a lot of money i did a lot of work i mean when youre flipping for yourself its a ton of work joe right tim and um i did a lot of work it was a major construction i mean we completely tore off the roof retrusted re configured everything it was it was major construction and for it being my first personal flip my timeline was blown way out of proportion um i had figured that it would originally taking about eight months um it ended up taking me about a year and half joe wow tim um crosstalk joe long time i actually ended up yeah during during opening the property actually refinanced it i found a bank that would uh refinance it at the the finish appraised value tim nice joe uh at the time which is good because you know at that time the banks were not exactly um how do you say? the banks are not exactly dotting all their is and crossing all their ts joe so this is still before the crash obviously tim yeah that was still before the crash joe giving away money joe right they were they were giving away money i refinanced the property got some money to finish it um as well as lower the payment um on the property for the next think it was like six months later the next actually sold it um so we brought it at like one ninety i put about eighty into it um i ended up selling it for three twenty um joe nice tim so i mean i did make some money on it i did pay some bills i did own it a long time um you know we paid the taxes on it for that full year um so you know we we did okay i mean you know it was it is an endower it was a real strain on my family it was a real strain on me laughs this especially with trying to run a business as well as as during the flip joe sure tim um you know doing it and when everything took off the two thousand eight as far as my foreclosure stuff my foreclosure business stuff um i would just glad to not have that property joe right tim because everything went crazy for me joe now did you? did you end up selling it then before the actual like the market tumbled or did you? tim yes joe oh tim i i wanna say i sold it two months before the actual craziness started joe right okay tim so i mean there was at the time there was on the news and everything like that there was talks of you know this cant last joe right tim bump bump bumb we foreshadow this coming blah blah blah all that stuff is coming out was getting really nervous laughs so joe wow tim yes joe you got pretty lucky then potentially right? tim i did yeah i did and uh you know its funny because i continuously i always check up on my stuff my old stuff and and what ive done in the past and see see what that property�s worth today is almost four hundred joe inaudible tim so the property value went up there i mean you know we went through a downturn were coming back up a little bit now joe sure tim uh you know so i think at that point i did a good job and you know i forwarded the property on their their uh got some inequity in it and you know it all works joe all right cool that was the first that was the first flip and that was uh like nine years ago right tim right joe roughly tim yeah joe actually ten eleven tim yeah it was a while ago crosstalk joe were getting old tim seems like forever joe were getting old tim right joe uh so tell me about i know that you got you focused on the foreclosure servicing you were doing which i know has a lot to do with what you know kind of how we met and what started our relationship i dont remember specifically what started it honestly but uh obviously we started working together probably i told the audience during the intro probably five or six years ago i cant remember specifically joe uh tim yeah i think thats right joe yeah and then you know youre you were doing a lot of contracting work in the general preservation stuff for the banks and then that kind of grew into uh you�re interested in getting back into flipping houses and investing in potentially investing in rentals at some point tim right joe so lets talk about the last couple deals youve done which are all you know some some of the things i want to i want to get out to the audience you know your experiences kind of starting from scratch again as a flipper tim yeah pretty much joe the contractor you you�ve got the background in the in the general contracting which i think is an advantage that a lot of obviously most people dont have but a tim right joe you know let�s talk about the last couple deals tim yeah i think the advantage comes when you know when you watch these shows on tv on hd tv and stuff like that you know youve got these people that think that they can go in and flip houses and they�re paying these contractors oh how much is it to change the water heater? oh five thousand? okay lets do it laughs you know those those people and you know i just kind of laughed at those people because you know the the prices that theyre paying for for doing general work in general construction is outrageous on tv you know im sure its inflated on tv to make it more dramatic but the you know yeah i mean you know being in the construction industry it it helped you know my my my favorites part everybodys got their favorite part of what they do and my stuff is basic you know interior trim working and so forth and so essentially the i got back into flipping and it was one of the properties that i had inspected for tennis group i cleaned it out for tanis group i winterized it for tanis group i cut the grass for it for tanis group i was the first one in the property uh you know after the previous owner had left in shambles and basically walked away from the property um thats one of the advantages that i have um i get to see a lot of the properties especially the foreclosures that when the people just leave im the first one in there i get to assess it myself i get to say okay there�s sixty thousand dollars� worth of repairs needed here�s how much i evaluate it at every every time i go to a property inaudible or whatever i have to do with those properties those foreclosure properties thats what im doing i�m constantly looking for deals the downside is that not a lot of the banks um will offer the property to an investor first joe right tim fannie freddie um those those companies actually first time home buyers thats thats the main goal in selling those property�s so those are those are little harder to come by but there are still banks out there that we deal with 7 joe sure joe that you know i i can be first in line this one property happened to be in carpentersville um i was i was first one in looking at it from the outside you could barely see it trees everywhere trees going through the roof and so forth but the uh i walked in and you know the bones were uh when you i guess when you you know i dont know how you do it joe but when i originally walkthrough property im looking at the end game as far as what i could make the property and what i can you know eventually turn it into and how much i expect it to sell at that point joe right tim if i walk into a property where as i can see it as okay i can add a bedroom here i can add a bathroom here up the value of those things and essentially you know ill then ill once im done with my work for the day ill go sit in my truck and ill say okay heres a much expect renovation to be blah blah blah and uh you know ill say hey im really interested in this property this particular property came back the numbers worked so i uh i have an investor that id like to call it ghost investor he happens to be a family member and he hes always kind of you know been pushing me in the direction hey lets lets flip some houses lets lets do some of this you know youre in the business lets lets see what we can do joe right tim so joe right joe so that day when i rekeyed that property i called him up and i said "hey i think ive got a property heres the status i�ll send you an email heres what i think heres what im gonna do with heres the expected amount of money im think i�m gonna spend here�s the sale price here is expected profit" joe right tim and he said "hey lets do it" so when the property came on the market i believe i was the first we were the first first initial offer joe yep tim and uh you know i think we got a couple other offers that raised my price a little bit more joe right tim i think they went up like five thousand some like that i think it was like a hundred twenty thousand dollar property um and you know there was no theres no kitchens theres no baths there was no light fixtures there was no hand railings there was no carpet there was there was nothing uh it was just basic basic bones house and id figured originally i could sell it you know closer to fifty uh the problem with that was that i didnt feel that the neighborhood could support the two hundred fifty dollars evaluation tim um and so essentially i i went back and did the numbers and you know to twenty five anywhere from two hundred to twenty five is where i came back so i basically ran the numbers backwards figured out how much i could spend and whether or not i could do it for that price so um my investors we did it close on the property i think in a couple weeks it was a pretty quick closing got the property got in there ran into an issue with permits uh the property was actually in a subdivision that was like a how to how you say it i dont even know what it was joe do you remember? joe you mean unincorporated? tim it was it a it wasnt it was inaudible i dont remember exactly what it was it was it wasn�t unincorporated because it had a standard address but it was it was a subdivision in dupage county im sorry cane county that um had its own ticket was annexed or something? some something of that nature so i ran into an issue getting the permit to do all the work um the the permit place cane county basically required me to do all this testing and the property did have mold as well the basement was flooded uh so essentially the all the county required me to do a bunch of testing remediation and so forth um which i all did i did all myself and you know a lot of people believe that when you buy a property you have to have it professionally remeated and thats not always the case you can do the remediation yourself as long as the test comes back negative youre in the clear because essentially that puts the um crosstalk inaudible puts the blame ion the testing company joe yeah and like before you get to into that that�s got to be somebody who knows what they are doing to some degree you have to have experience tim absolutely i i do that for the banks i do that for for so inaudible and its not something i would recommend to a novice whatsoever joe right right tim but you know if you have a general knowledge if you did a little research and um online and figured out reading some books on it and so forth you can to actually purchase the chemicals that the the big companies use to to kill that nasty stuff and um it�s not that hard and you know if you protect yourself its not that that dangerous joe right right joe so i did that on my own basically took almost three weeks to get the actual permit to start work which i did not figure so did all the work put in the kitchen couple of baths i added on a bedroom this property was a split level property so i added a it had a split level with the basement so i added a bedroom into the split the bottom split level part which made it a four bedroom two and a half baths from a three bedroom two and a half bath joe right tim so it is added a little bit of value there um and essentially did it did it i think in three months um joe yeah tim start to finish and you know with all the permit issues and inspections and so forth and then we had sold within thirty days i think joe yeah i think we had a contract pretty quick tim yeah is under contract pretty quick um that one went fairly well i think we purchased it at one ninety we sold it at two eighteen joe no now we purchase tim no im sorry not one ninety we purchased it at one nineteen sorry joe i think it was lower than that actually i think not that were going to argue but i thought you picked it up for like one0five tim i i think that was my initial offer joe oh okay tim and then i think it got driven up with other other offers joe okay tim and uh yeah cause you actually you vouched for me with the bank on that one joe yeah tim you said this is a good buyer so we uh yeah we got the property at call it one twenty joe yep tim and uh i think we put forty into it all in at one sixty we ended up selling it for two fifteen joe yep tim um which is you know it�s fairly uncommon you know and i will call it ive heard you call it a unicorn before laughs joe that was a good deal tim um it is a good deal and you know and it it it were blessed to have it joe yup tim you know we we all part of that too to tanis group and to mister mueller joe that�s me tim yeah joe i want to talk about that real quick because its too two things that youre bringing up that i just want to reiterate one is you brought up something i think thats really important that a lot of especially since were kind of focusing on the fact that this is like a newer you know newer investor success stories you when you look at these properties you have a vision of what can i do to take to take this to take this uh to take this footprint and make it something better due to actually add value to the property besides just the rehab like youre talking about adding bedrooms tim right joe adding bathrooms i mean there are there are investors out there that that do that on a routine level is every part of the rehab but you were you were kind of walking right into the game like you know what can i do to take this this three bedroom two and a half baths and make it a four bedroom two and a half bath? thus adding you know another fifteen twenty grand you know approximately where the value and i think most investors when theyre started they dont really think that way they�re theyre just looking at you know what can i do to to get in and out of this property quickly? you know i see that i see i see i hear about other investors doing it it seems pretty easy let�s just fix up stuff you know what what do we do minimize work and as opposed to really digging into the bones of the property and making it you know tim right joe increasing the value uh naturally just by adding to it which i think is incredible the second part is that you brought up like working with tanis which i appreciate the plug but also you know like you said i mean its not that easy to find these banks that are that have inventory that are actually willing to sell to investors right out of the get go and what had happen in this situation was were in a multiple offer and the the asset manager for the bank which is a you know theyre a regional bank it�s not a little local mom and pop bank but yeah they were bigger bank they they were faced with a beeps decision of what what do i do when ive got offers that are basically very similar to each other because we submitted all the offers i mean you really werent given an there was no unfair advantage tim right and you you specifically submitted those offers because thats your job so joe yeah offers went in tim its joe and i think ill be honest i think we had one if remember i thought we had one that was actually a little bit higher than yours that was also a cash offer but the asset manager recognize that i was representing you on the buy side tim right joe and they called me and said this is your buyer like this guys gonna close right i�m like aw yeah absolutely hundred twenty percent positive hes going to close and they said okay we�re willing to take you know a little bit less money which i think literally was like five hundred bucks or something but tim right crosstalk it wasnt much joe were willing to take less in order to make sure this deal closes because were taking your word for it joe so the thing i want to point out to the people that are listening as a new investor is its not so much that you need to call joe mueller from tanis group tim yeah you do joe yeah you do laughs you need to work with you need to work with a broker that actually has experience in the niche that youre trying to invest in so whether its the relationships with the banks whether its the fact that they know the sellers you know of a of a regular retail property you know those things are important because its its a relationship business when it comes down to it so dont just call you know ive said this before but you know your second cousin who just got the real estate license six months ago who decides they want to represent flippers probably not the best guy or gal to start out with maybe maybe down the line once theyve got a couple deals under their belt work with somebody thats got experience in that market because theyre gonna be able to help you succeed is all i wanna bring all i wanna bring across so tim it make sense absoulty makes sense when you know that a broker has experience experience in the in the business that you want to be in those are the people that you need to network worth with that you need to seek out use and get their advice and take it to hear because theyre the ones doing it you know the the the mom and pops that just start up that just got their licenses so forth if you want to sell with them and get them some experience and you know get on their good side and you know give a property that way that thats one thing but buying on the properties it its a its a whole nother ball game then selling joe yep joe um you know selling these days is essentially you know you put it on a bunch of websites and mls and youre listing all the other agents do the work essentially is its not joe yep a hundred percent tim its its not rocket science these days um joe no it�s not no it�s hot tim and and uh yeah having the experience broker do the work for you you know maybe theyre doing cmas for you you know i mean i think on this one i called you up and im like "hey you know can you give me the counts for this area joe sure tim blah blah blah you know and you know you did it i think i think we did it over the phone joe right tim and i said hey its a good deal and i you know i told you i was in on it and that i get the money and it all worked out so joe yep tim yeah yeah thats getting back into it um you know after construction business slowdown that you know that helps and you know having the relationship that we had and still do it helped me i mean it was a huge help cause otherwise id be going into it blind and thats you know the first time first time flippers and so forth like that youre youre basically going into a blind and having that broker that has that experiences its worth its weight in gold thats how i consider it so0 joe i think its even even and even on the the wholesaler side when youre working with wholesalers obviously we talk about that a lot of the podcasts and you and i kind of talk about wholesaling quite a bit i mean theres tim um hum joe theres so many even last night we had a we had a meeting last night at the office we had won the meet up group meetings with dan clarkens group i think its called the investor tim um hum joe action and accountability group we had a couple newer people there that were talking about how they wanted the wholesale in order to kind of get started and you know once they made some money theyre going to get into slipping and and and owning rental property tim um hum joe uh and its interesting ta to have those conversations because they really dont know what do you do even if they got a contract on a property at a good price you know that the next couple steps i mean its its not as simple as just get a property under contract in just you know throwing out throwing out an email blast and hoping that it closes you know cross your fingers there�s theres a process so again going back to the you know the relationship side of business you got to have the right contacts you got to you got to get to know people in your market you got to deal with people that have experience again everyones got to get started but you know then if if youre working with a wholesaler it doesnt necessarily have a lot of experience but maybe brought you a good opportunity you know consult with someone who knows what theyre doing that can help you guys get through the process to get the property closed cause its not that simple but tim its not and that that relates to the to the third blip that im doing right now joe okay tim um where um this property i was working on the second flip um which was in crystal lake which was a dan clarton wholesale deal joe right right tim um the the third property basically basically fell in my lap um my drywaller guy that was doing the work at the second flip that i just closed on basically came and said "hey you want to buy a house down the road?" my buddys getting a divorce and they just want to unload the house joe right tim and i was thrown into the wholesale side of the property side of the business um you know hand over foot i mean i was i was thrown in there thrown in the water and i basically said yeah of course i want to by a property so i went and i looked at the property and it is the situation was basically um the husband and wife who got divorced she was the one that was making all the money paying all the bills he was unemployed at the time essentially she left him so he was at the house he could afford the house um the payments on the house first electric the taxes and so forth joe right tim found out later that his mother on the house free and clear and that she are originally bought it as a rental we back in like nineteen eighty five i want to say it was a really long time that shes owned this property joe right tim and she had left her son she had trusted the property entrusted the property to her son and his his wife at the time and now they got divorced and he could afford to live at the property they want to unload the property joe right tim so i went there and had an initial and initial talk with them and you know her her number was you know right about its a three bedroom one of a half baths property that had an addition on the back that was kind of kind of a four season but not really it was fully insulated it was a nice addition nice wood ceiling a nice addition joe i remember seeing it yup tim and uh you know she she basically came back her number was at one fifty from from all of her internet searches and shes like i want one fifty for the property and i told her i couldnt do it straight up to her face i said i can�t do it you know i told my number was more around the one and i had my initial assessment of property was this is a great rental it�s ready to go you know its gonna make money for sure i did you know before i even got there others run the inaudible on my phone running the rental numbers i think i even called you joe yup tim and said hey hey joe help me out with this you know let me know what you think what do you think rents gonna be? blah blah blah you know rental rental came back i think it was a fifteen or sixteen hundred the property next door was is almost the same property and its renting for sixteen fifty um and so i was like wow thats thats fairly good numbers at you know i got to see what i can get the property for joe right tim so she originally came back at one fifty i basically told i cant do that i was more in the one thirtyish range um and i said you know you know what i heres deal i said let me try to get and you know wholesaling this is my first wholesale deal so i dont know what to do i im im mister honest when it comes to the construction work to to anything you know if beeps i think its going to cost three thousand dollars to put in your kitchen thats how much i charge you know i dont joe right tim i can charge than eight thousand no you know i charge three thousand and thats it so i told her i said you know im at the one thirty mark let me do this i gave her dan cartons number and dan if youre listening im sorry the deal didnt work out laughs for you but dan came back and he offered what felt you know the property was worth it what he was willing to do on the property you know its its two different business models um between dan and i about what he expected to do the property and what i expected to do with the property um and the lady took the offer from dan which was i believe he offered a monthly payment for ex amount of years and was going to do it as a rental or you know assign the contract to someone and and and wholesale the property joe right tim so um i basically gave that to dan dan went there as soon as dan left she called me back and she said well dan was just here will you give me one fifteen for the property and i said absolutely laughs ill be right there joe yeah that was a little bit of a tag team deal i like it tim it was it was kind of a good good cop bad cop which was not planned whatsoever joe right tim we did not plan that we had talked about doing that you know to where it could work to some peoples advantage but you know we we had not planned it and it just fell in our lap joe sure tim and you know i ended up purchasing the property which that property i actually i told her i would give her one fifteen all in which i guess was a kind of an unconventional type of offer for what you say essentially she paid all the real estate taxes she paid all of my closing costs she played all of my uh she paid everything i was all in at one fifteen joe right so you basically said like im gonna give you a net sale price of one fifteen no nothing more any other costs that go into this transaction its its come out of her pocket tim exactly joe i love it i think thats great tim and you know i i wish real estate transaction would be more more of that you know straight forward kind of like youre buying a car heres how much it cost joe right tim um but you know that they always add the taxes they always at the dealership fees they always add this joe sure tim it would be you know it be great if you said okay heres a much im going to give you either you take it or leave it and thats thats what i did and she she took it she signed the contract she took the contract to her lawyer she didnt even want to see the contract i took the country to our lawyer um who was a divorce lawyer and i know how that worked in there but um joe sure tim i guess lawyers are lawyers joe lawyers are lawyers yep tim and uh she she looked over the contract basically called me and said �hey this is not a contract" and it was actually a contract that you forwarded me joe right tim um that you use in your wholesale stuff and i said �yes absolutely its a contraction if she signs it shes uh shes bound to do it" and uh we went that direction and the lawyer agreed okay its a contract we closed on the property i think in ten days twelve days joe yeah its pretty impressive tim yeah and i guess when youve got the cash to its a flaunting in somebody�s face they they jump as hard as they can um which you know i immediately called my investor we immediately got going on the deal and uh purchased the property and that ones currently under under construction almost done uh and that was two months ago two months ago? joe right yeah tim and you know this property of was originally when i walked through i originally thought it was going to be a rental um and after purchasing it at that one fifteen number and doing some more uh comps in the area and its actually because it went really fast i didnt have time to sit down and really rally look at enough at everything which you always wanna do your due diligence you always want to do that this was a very fast deal i had to like run over there kind of scenario um after looking at all the numbers i felt that that addition on the back could be made into a fourth bedroom and then i could also because it was a three bedroom one and a half bath so i basically changed it to a four bedroom two bath joe right tim so i added a shower to the first floor bath which is kind of awkward um as far as you know having a shower on your first floor um because essentially all your guests are going to use the bathroom but essentially i made the shower into to a super fancy shower joe yup tim you know and and um so its more of a show piece as opposed to a you know super functional basic stand up shower it�s its kind of a show piece so i i think that buyers will look at it and say �hey thats kind of cool" you know never mind the awkwardness of having a bathroom on the first floor or a shower on your first floor joe hey now hey now we put a shower in my first four bathroom of my house tim you did joe yeah tim you did and it thats where that�s where the idea came from joe ah ha tim you know we we did we did your shower and its like a super fancy shower like a car wash kind of thing you know and it works joe right tim you know i mean you know you never know what youre gonna have a guest that stays over and says hey can i use your shower? go for it joe right tim kind of thing so um yeah after doing the counts and so forth you know we brought it at one fifteen i expect to list at two forty joe two forty tim probably sell it im joe wow tim gonna list it at two forty wait until you haven�t seen it joe i saw i saw the before i havent seen what youve done with it tim right it�s amazing joe oh yeah? tim amazing yeah crosstalk tim i i i kind of went above and beyond beeps i guess thats what i do but you know i i dont the way that i i flip properties versus the way a lot of people flip properties is i use a lot of my sweat equity a lot of it i do a lot of excess trim work i do a lot of over and above stuff that the stuff that you see on tv but it doesnt cost me that much money joe sure tim um because i do it all myself um i�m a big preacher of work work work you know your rewards will be will be earned in the end joe sure tim um you know i put in all this extra work to do this stuff i�m expecting to list at two forty and i expect it to sell out about two twenty five in the end joe crosstalk okay tim no i always list high thats kind of part of my deal i know you beat me up about it you call me crazy and you laugh at me laughs and you no you dont laugh maybe you do but um joe maybe a little 7 tim um joe nice laughs tim but i i still with in the end don�t i? joe yeah its been working tim crosstalk yeah joe it works i�m just more than mind im just more of a you know and i just had this conversation with another investor last night i would rather id rather price it appropriately i take that back the way you do your work its a little bit different because youre youre doing such an improvement to the property that you know its hard for me to see you know we have an expectation of what the potential price could be tim um hum joe but when youre going the rehab quality that youre putting into these properties a lot of times it creates a challenge on you know my end to really put a hard and fast number on it tim um hum joe and the converse side of that is i can always tell you know when and investor list of property to high that did a bunch of shit work tim right joe and ends up trying to put lipstick on a pig and i brought up stuff like that before where they they they you know they they dont even a lot of effort into the rehab and they just try to you know like i said lipstick the pig and in the end their priced twenty or thirty thousand higher than they should be there�s no way thats going to sell at that pricing tim right joe but your your situation is a little different so tim yeah well the the last one that we just closed on yesterday um literally had i believe it was thirty two walk throughs and multiple second walkthroughs within a thirty day period joe right tim so um i mean i guess that would kind of give you an idea of the type of property that i�m putting out you know it its a very eye appealing so somebody sees it online joe right tim they go holy cow i gotta go see that and you know just getting the people to walk through is the main thing joe right tim we went through a lot of people i think we got we only got two offers we got one initial offer and then the of the offer that i accepted which was a full price offer joe right tim um which is another story um joe well i do want ta i kind of want to talk about this last deal just because the inspiration for the podcast came from the fact that you just picked up a big fat check from the title company yesterday which is what its all about tim right joe so i mean we kind of we kind of digressed to the one youre currently finishing up so that was going to hit the market soon so that�s going to be your third rehab in the last what is it like last year or so? year and a half tim yeah about that joe okay so lets lets talk about the second one which you just closed as far as sold to an end buyer lets go over the numbers on that one and how it all kind of went down and and then yeah lets talk about your one eyed appraiser friend and how that works out laughs tim yeah the one eyed appraiser right joe yes tim um on this this second property which i guess were going backwards but joe thats okay tim um the second property uh we picked up this was a this was a deal from i believe it was you had originally called me on it and said "hey you want to go check out this property?" joe right tim and it ended up being a dan clarton deal joe right tim where the initial owner of the property um her husband died a couple months back um and she had actually gone into a assisted living type scenario joe right tim she didnt have any family in the immediate area and basically gave power of attorney to one of the neighbors joe right tim who was a cpa which she had never done a power of attorney like that before obviously basically you and me both we met up at the property ran through it um came up you know worked our numbers backwards you know figured hey this could sell for two fortyish you know easy you know lower to mid lower to mid two hundred all day long joe right tim and you know i think our our initial number was hey i forgot what did i pay for that one? i dont remember laughs joe uh i think you paid one fifteen for it tim one i got that�s what i was going to say let�s say it was one fifteen that was that was with the assignment fee as well joe yep yeah there was uh i think like there was a seven or eight thousand dollar assignment build into that tim yep there was which im happy to pay if somebodys somebody�s willing to find me a property and you know has a connection or you know a lot of people would would frown at that that you know eight thousand dollars off the top you know that a lot people would frown at that the amount of work and effort that it takes to find these properties and and get those properties under contract and do what you gotta do is it�s a lot it�s a grind its its a lot of hustling its huge work joe right tim and i i see the value you in it a lot of people may not i do [00471007 and if it helps me and it may not help everyone because essentially a lot of you know a lot of flippers you know they got their contractors that they that they use and you know they pay them a set price for x amount and theyve got you know everything runs like a robot and its not not always a robot for everyone joe right tim and joe right tim um you know someone someone like me if it works for me because ive got you know the equity of being able to do the property and do all the work on the property myself i�ve got that equity that i can work in there as far as you know paying eight thousand dollars up front hey lets do it the numbers work for me joe right tim so um we got the we got the property i think we closed on that one two weeks two i think we can close out on that one fairly quick as well plus joe that just an interesting point to bring up that was a that was a personal connection that uh dan clarton had through one of the other neighbors i believe how he found it tim right joe i believe the initial and he might be able to correct me so i may be wrong here but i though the initial way that it came to him was he was forwarded a link through facebook because it was on like a facebook garage sale site like the chrystal lake garage sale site and he realized or the person that send it to a new that he was you know that hes a wholesaler and said "hey you might want to talk to this lady because theyre gonna be dumping off this house and here it is on the facebook garage sale site" tim um hum joe and thats how it worked out so that kind of interesting tim yeah and i think the actual the neighbor i think was also bidding on the property as well joe uh were they? tim yeah i think so because you know after after we got the property and he said he came over and talked to me and he�s like congratulations blah blah blah i couldnt see making that number work and blah blah blah i believe were bedding against him so or dan was not me but dan was originally so joe really? tim yeah joe yeha i don�t know if we knew that tim laughs well now you know so um joe right tim but yeah you know dan you know you know i see what dan does dan goes out there and hustles and signs and phone calls and holy cow i cant imagine the amount of work it is joe its a huge amount of work tim so um that one id gladly paid the eight thousand dollars sign in fee um and i knew what it was um and you know youve talked before on your podcast about lawyers you know going through the contracts and you know they say "hey whats this eight thousand dollars for?" and so forth joe right tim you know what not we actually got a got a lawyer that was well versed in that type of sale and we close it in two weeks and you know no problems and uh we got working on it working on it right away the property itself was a three bed room one and half bath full basement two car garage attached uh in chrystal lake and basically the lady was a book hoarder joe right tim she had books after books after books after books um when joe and i originally saw the property the uh property was being cleaned out you know you walk into the basement and you could hardly walk so we couldn�t really see everything as wed like to but we knew what were capable of and we knew what our end game was beeps and so you know i felt like i talked to my um my investor made the offer closed the deal so we started working on the property we got there there were still some uh some stuff left which i was okay with thats what i do for a living i clean out houses uh so there was still some stuff left that i agreed to uh basically make the deal go faster instead of waiting for her to clean out all the stuff i said "just leave it" and lets close it uh so i had a little bit of garbage left in there and uh got into the property and the basement had some mold discoloration in it and um basically it was from the lady leaving the window open because she couldnt reach the window because of all her books um so she had left it open at one point and uh it was more like an easement window so it had a cover on it so rain was just kind of seeping in there and there was a little bit of discoloration which i didnt originally see which i remeated myself and tested and its all good um then um i i basically what i like to do when i get into a property and i like to figure my end buyer what type of buyer im looking for and this particular property this would be a high end first time buyer is what i figured um to where beeps you know theyve got theyve got a significant amount of money to put down over the twenty percent and uh theyre looking for a specific type of house um or i was looking for a buyer that was kind of an executive kind of buyer that um was looking for a smaller house after their kids have already gone and theyre looking for a higher end house that they could relax in it so essentially i build the property to do exactly that um i struggled with putting the comps because having a three one and half in that particular area it was one of the lower end properties um and not lowered end as far as the style of the house or anything like that the styles perfect matching everything else in eh neighborhood um but everything else was either four two and a half and so forth so essentially i struggled with the idea of putting a basement bathroom in which you know for me to do it would have cost me probably twenty five hundred three thousand dollars to do um you know breaking up concrete putting in a stand up shower and so for the to make it a three bedroom two and a half and i stuffed with it because i i had enough room in the basement but it wasnt part of my original plan um so i i axed that idea and i basically went with a high end finish plan where i did five piece wayne�s coating in the living room dining room kitchen first floor bath um i did a really nice wood floor um i did um like in the kitchen cabinets i did a four piece crown molding and so on and so forth like that those types of finishes that are easy for me to do and they may be pretty pricey for the standard flipper to do you know to call the contractor and say "hey i want five piece wayne�s coating on these walls" that contractor�s goanna you know his eyes are gonna light up with dollar signs joe right tim so he uh you know for me to do it its sweat equity thats all it is joe right tim and uh the hard work to do that stuff paid off in the end uh because i you know when you look at a property that has those high end finishes on a line verses just a standard flip which there was one down the street that came up for sale two weeks before mine did joe right tim uh and was priced higher than mine but it had more bedrooms ill give them that um and one more bath but it was priced higher than mine which at that point i feel i felt that it was you know it was priced right right around the two fifty range joe sure tim um and uh i think we came in at two fifty we originally priced it at two fifty five shooting for the stars joe okay tim and uh you know after the first i think it was right at thirty days we had thirty people walk through it um and i lowered the price five thousand against against joe muellers recommendation joe laughs ] tim and we we only lowered it five joe recommend ten uh which my situ my particular situation where im not i dont have carrying cost like i dont i don�t have a hard money loan on the property i don�t have a standard loan on three property it�s my ghost investor i don�t i don�t have any expenses you know meaning you know holding it and extra couple of days or an extra month uh doesnt cost me as much as a standard flipper thats got loans and hard money and that type of scenario so i dont mind um and id rather get the price that i�m looking for then just drop it and sell it quick joe right tim and uh you know thats kind of my and i don�t believe ive ever told you that that�s my game plan on everything that�s my game plan uh get maximum value because essentially its not costing me anything to do that so um so we flipped the property i think i put we got the property at one fifteen we put sixty into it were all in at one seventy five we walked away with a check yesterday for almost two twenty five joe nice so i guess you can call that a second unicorn laughs um if youre a your crosstalk like a youre like a unicorn breeder tim keeping track im a unicorn magnet how about that? joe there you go tim and uh no essentially i chalk it up to the hard work and it�s not just me it�s my family does a lot of work at the properties uh my wife and kids actually come help me paint um theyre great painters which as soon as they hit sixteen seventeen theyre going to be looking to handouts to go play with their friends i�m gonna say hey let�s get the paint brushes going and lets do some painting joe crosstalk put them on the payroll tim and joe i love it tim yeah exactly so you got to teach them right from the start so um joe thats a good idea i love it tim you know any any place that you can get sweat equity from or any type of method or anything that you can do on your own im a strong believer that thats gonna pay off in the end and this particular property it did im grateful joe awesome so you got yourself a nice big check today youre going to run it over to your investor and get it deposited and hopefully uh cut some checks back and fought i�m guessing tim yep yep joe todays a good day for tim were recording a podcast to kind of go over so uh just kind of wrapping it up what type of advice would you you actually had a lot of great advice for the listener a lot of stuff that people haven�t said yet which i think is awesome uh what else do you want to add maybe to kind of bring out there to tim crosstalk well joe some of these people that are just getting started newer investors or maybe experienced investors cause obviously youre you know we call them unicorns but these these are deals beneath everyone�s noses its not like this is not something that is impossible to accomplish tim right joe i think that the attitude you have is a little bit different is youre pretty diligent on not just accepting whatever property comes on the table i mean youre pretty youre pretty good about tim right joe you know doing your research and hunting down the right deal instead of just jumping on whatever opportunity falls in your lap so i think that 87 tim right joe i think thats a point to bring up what else do you want to add maybe so we can kind of talk about that for a minute tim um i i guess i would i�m a strong believer in in the hard work thats the main thing if you know it totally fries my brain that you know you see these people on tv that go out there and they make it look like oh we made three hundred thousand dollars on this one property in california like come on joe laughs tim there theres no way unless youre doing major major major construction changing the property you know adding huge bedrooms you know ridiculous amount of stuff and spending a ridiculous amount of money youre not gonna it�s just your return on youre investment is not there theres no way joe right tim and um you know you got to do your due diligence you absolutely have to do that um you have to um you have to know your end game um who you have to know who youre actually shooting for like the property in carpentersville i knew my buyer i knew the buyer before i even started work i knew the person that would buy it and that was the person that brought it i mean i knew that the person um would have multiple the specific property had an extralarge driveway area with some extra cars where you could put some extra cars joe right tim so i i structured the property towards that and by doing so you know if you know youre markets and you know the people that you are shooting for it all ends up in the end the same thing happened with this last property that i just closed yesterday i knew the buyer would be a first time home buyer and i knew that theyd want the high end finish the people came from um from chicago at a high end they were renting high end apartments just had their first kid just out of college first time home buyers joe right tim they they were looking for something you know they had more than twenty percent down they had a they had a great offer and i knew it going in thats what i was looking for and its you know whether it takes thirty or fifty people to walk through the house you know and how many times i got to mop the floor it doesnt matter to me thats you know thats what you got to do to get to that end buyer the buyers are out there i mean the market the way the markets looking now um you know to me its looking like a sellers� market at this point joe crosstalk absoulty absolutely it�s a sellers� market tim and joe a hundred percent tim yeah if youve got the if youve got the properties and if you market it as a specific property to a specific buyer and you want to keep that higher end um evaluation oh we never even talked about the one eyed appraiser joe thats fine we got time go for it tim going to the evaluation of the property joe right tim the particular property we got a full price offer at two forty nine nine joe right tim which i was ecstatic about it�s exactly what i wanted um no con no sales contingency just a mortgage contingency and so i accepted the accepted the offer joe um hum tim and um got down went to the inspection the inspection was great i have a few little things to fix um they wanted me to add a railing in the garage for the one step which was weird to me but joe laughs tim okay ill do it um you now little stuff like that you know nothing nothing major um so i i agreed to eve4rythign obviously you know thats the best thing you can do um is treat youre buyers like theyre like theyre kings and queens and so forth and uh and always im almost always going to accept any type of repairs cause ive gone through the property myself already i�m going to accept any type of repairs that you want to do cause i do them myself it�s not going to cost me that much money im almost always gonna do that joe right tim so we did that i accepted that we had the appraiser walk through i met the appraiser there i actually heard chris davis shout out to chris davis joe yep tim and uh he had mentioned in one of his podcast with you joe yep tim that um hey you should meet youre appraiser there to to show them what uh show them what was done joe right tim and an appraisers going to walk up to a property they don�t care that the roofs new they don�t care that the windows are new joe they might tim the crosstalk sidings new joe they might not even they don�t know that tim right joe i mean it might look brand new but for all they know its two years old five years old i mean tim right they have no clue so they�re basically theyre running through these properties um and theyre doing all their work on the computer when they get home joe right right tim you know theyre basically there to take pictures so they they don�t have a clue about whats new and what you did and so forth so i met the appraiser there where i was in the property i was doing the repairs for the sale putting up that little uh hand rail and uh the appraiser walked in and he literally had an eye patch over his one eye and he was a big heavy set dude that had a limp joe laughs tim and basically walked into my property the property had like an entry foyer thing where you step down into the main house and he almost killed himself laughs he almost he almost lost it and i almost lost it because you know if youre gonna come and evaluate my property and you know nothing against the one eyed guy but uh i just want to make sure that youre gonna evaluate it properly and uh so i basically went through and talked to him he was a nice guy you know nothing against the guy and uh uh i think it was like he came on like a friday so i had to wait for the weekend to get the appraisal back something of that nature like three or four days i�m waiting an finally it comes back and its short two hundred and forty four thousand dollars joe right tim and fifty nine hundred dollars short so i you know in my situation normally what i would do is i would kill the deal cause it doesnt cost me any money and i would i would not necessarily kill the deal i would say i would go back to the buyers and say hey you need to come up with this money joe right tim which in a lot of cases would kill the deal um which i did i went back to the buyers and i said hey you offered me this amount of money i need that amount of money" because in my eyes granted its not standard real estate talk and so forth in my eyes something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it so if you offered me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this house i believe that you should pay me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this house joe sure tim regardless of what someone who walks through the property for fifteen minutes he was literally there for fifteen minutes joe right tim what that person that one person out of the tens and thousands of appraisers that we have in the chicagoland area that one guy said it was fifty nine hundred dollars short joe right tim so i basically went back to my buyer and i said "hey you need to come up with the money" and uh they basically came back and said no we cant weve got to put a deck in the back and we want to do all this landscaping and blah blah blah and i said well if youve got money to do that youve got money to pay me either you want the house or you don�t um and then we went back and forth a couple of times and it almost killed the deal joe right i remember tim which which uh you know moneys money to me it doesnt hurt me to keep the property a couple extra days especially when i got thirty something people walking through it so um went back and forth and finally i offered them i said okay im not gonna do any of these other repairs" um which the inspector found with the handrails and stuff like that i think i i put up one hand rail and that was it and you know cause cause i was waiting for the appraiser that day so i only did one thing and uh so i said i�m not going to do any of the other repairs which i probably valued at maybe fifteen hundred dollars you know cut some trees back change the gfi that wasnt working stuff like that joe right tim nothing major and uh crosstalk inaudible joe simple fixes tim simple fixes so i basically went back to them and i said "hey im not gonna do any of these other repairs take it or leave it thats the deal" so they accepted that i didnt do any of the other repairs and uh we we sold it at two forty four and you know we made some money joe great tim we made some money for sure so joe yeah it sounds like a pretty healthy deal i mean it sounds like another unicorn i love it tim um hum joe i think i might have to change the title of the pod cast to something about uh newer investor and laughs his three his three new unicorns joe its awesome uh tim yeah joe so i mean i i like the point you brought up i think that�s something that everyone needs to follow suit with which is always always always meet your buyers appraiser at the property uh some of the things that ive done in the past and ive heard of other investors doing is actually having proof of like sometimes the before and after as well so if tim yep joe if youre if youre buying a real hunk of junk uh you know filled with mold or whatever the situation is it�s a good idea to maybe maybe have some before pictures there as well so he gets a conceptually can visualize literally how much work went into the property tim um hum joe or she um so thats a great point and be there to answer questions and advise you know what what the potential cost and value of some of the repairs is because thats what it comes down to as well if youre dumping fifty thousand into a property and that appraiser doesn�t rally have a have an idea of how much money really went into it you know its the investors job to push that information on to him tim uh hum joe so tim right and he he did asked me how much money did i invest in the property joe okay tim um when we were there he did ask me how much money do you think you have got into it? i told him straight out heres how much ive go into it and he wrote it down on his little note pad and joe right tim went about taking pictures so joe right tim it it defiantly i think it paid off a little bit because secondly he didn�t even know there was he didnt even go into the basement i said joe really? tim he was ready to leave and i said "arent you gonna go into the basement?" and he hes like oh theres a basement? i mean eventually he would have found it you know if he had the tax records or whatever um joe yeah but thats tim you know he didn�t yeah and it just totally blew my mind like hey there�s another door right there you could have went down the door joe wow tim you know he uh yeah i had to show him the basement so joe wow well thats a great point i mean yes so sometimes think about if you werent there and he had no clue that there was a basement and he just you kw would have acted like it was obsolete when he did his appraisal it could have knocked another twenty grand off the value so tim right right and it�s a finished basement so you know finished verses unfinished and youve got value there so joe absolutely tim right joe all right well uh i think thats about all were gonna do today tim weve been on the podcast for like an hour and twenty minutes or something at this point tim whoa whoa wow joe it�s gone tim time flies joe time fly�s when youre having fun uh tim yep joe hopefully our listeners got a lot out of this one lot of good information thank you for taking the time and exposing youre uh youre personal investment philosophies and some of the financials that go with it i know thats not easy to do and uh tim um hum joe i appreciate it tim yeah well i appreciate you having me it was fun we should do it again joe all right we can do it again i know we got to talk we got to talk about working with contractors thats gonna be the next podcast we do tim yes i would love to do a contractor
