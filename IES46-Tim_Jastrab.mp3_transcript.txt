We're gonna try something new today. 
 The car casting take two with the awesome new little mini recorder. 
 The Investor Empowerment Series Radio Show.
 Episode number forty six. 
Uh, today were are going to interview Tim Jastrab. 
TMJ asset services.
Tim has been a contractor that I've worked with for quite some time.
[00:00:25.03] I’m gonna guess uh, five, six years, maybe more.
[00:00:27.05] Uh, he’s worked on a lot of the REO properties that we manage for the banks out there.
[00:00:32.26] I think that's how we initially came across each other, somehow some way and and he's also worked on my personal rental portfolio as well as some of the flips I’ve done.
[00:00:46.01] And I would say about a year and a half ago or so Tim started showing a really, uh, high interest in flipping on his own.
[00:00:55.24]  Being Joe Mueller the type of person that I am I was one hundred percent supportive of his decision to uh, maybe take a step back from the general contracting aspect of his business and then start working on the investment side which is really what he wants to do. 
[00:01:18.14] The fix and flipping and building a rental portfolio.
 Matter fact I know he listens to podcast and he often ask questions in comments on some of the things that are said.
[00:01:24.22] Or brought up on the podcast so I appreciate that.
[00:01:31.23] Happy to have him on today as a guest. 
[00:01:31.04] Again, this is the Investor Empowerment radio show.

[00:02:32.19] Today's guest, as I described earlier is Tim Jastrow from TMJ asset services.
[00:02:35.01] Tim, thank you for being on the show today 
[00:02:37.10] Tim:  Thank you for having me. 
[00:02:38.26] I really, really appreciate all of your hard work and your dedication to the podcast and all of the uh, information that you put forth. 
[00:02:48.17] Joe:   Come on you suck up.
[00:02:49.18] Cut it out. (Laughs)
[00:02:53.21] Tim: Yeah, you got to do a little of that. 
[00:02:55.02] Joe: It's all good and I appreciate you saying that. 
[00:02:57.00] I know you listen I I had actually I  brought that up in the intro about how I know you listen the stuff because you're  always asking me questions about stuff that  I say or other people say or whatever goes on and I think that's you know it's a good way to learn you know. 
[00:03:08.12] Tim:   yeah.
[00:03:11.20] Yeah, absolutely if if you're not the not listening to stuff if you're not trying to forward uh, you’re learning and your information and your business partnerships, everything like that, you're, you're moving backwards.
[00:03:25.18] Joe:  Yep.
[00:03:25.18] Tim: So, absolutely.
[00:03:26.19] Every, every little bit helps.   


[00:03:33.03] Joe:  Cool. 
[00:03:33.29] So I know you, I know you got your start technically a ways back.
[00:03:40.07] I know you're flipping down in Aurora at one point.
[00:03:41.03] Tim:  Yup.
[00:03:41.03] Joe:  And you kind of put that on hiatus and focus on your your general contracting business.
[00:03:44.19] Why don’t, why don’t we just kind of give a little history of what you're all about.
[00:03:47.16] I mean I know I know the story but nobody else does.
[00:03:49.13] So let’s, lets, kind of dive in for a few minutes.
[00:03:50.20] Tim:  Yeah.
[00:03:50.20] Joe:  About who you are and how it all got started. 
[00:03:51.28] Tim:  Okay, um, my business actually started as a partnership with my best friend back in I believe it was ninety nine or two thousand. 
[00:04:02.15] We essentially started a company that serviced uh, foreclosure properties for one specific broker out of Schaumburg and um, essentially we started doing like foreclosure cleanouts. 
[00:04:20.17] All the things necessary for bank servicing re-keys winterization. 
[00:04:25.24] Gas cuts and so forth.
[00:04:29.16] Um, we started servicing that one broker and eventually uhm, which I don't recommend anybody as far as with your best friends or anything like that is partnering  with them that's that's not the greatest idea. 
[00:04:41.05] Joe:  Right,
[00:04:41.05] Tim:  Um, you hear all the horror stories about that.
[00:04:45.13] eventually we split ways.
[00:04:47.22] I created my own TMJ asset back in two thousand one and essentially started servicing brokers.
[00:04:55.05] Um, I took on a second part of my business which I'm a strong believer in I'm not keeping all your eggs in one basket.
[00:05:04.16] Um, basically it's a foreclosure inspection company.
That, the banks require any time the property goes into foreclosure foreclosure bankruptcy and so forth. 
[00:05:18.21] Those properties need to be um, checked on, because if a property were to go vacant. You know in the middle of winter there's going to be damage to the property. 
[00:05:29.19] it’s the it's the bank's responsibility to maintain those properties and to maintain those values of those properties.
[00:05:35.09] Joe: Right
[00:05:35.09] Joe:   So the banks essentially needed all these contractors during you know, during the downturn there. 
[00:05:43.17] That uh, that service these vacant houses and essentially at one point we were doing thirty five hundred uh, vacancy inspections and and bankruptcy inspections and so forth per month.
[00:05:55.14] Um, and I had a huge crew of guys doing that,
[00:05:59.16] Um after that started to downturn which it's it's so going the company still going. 
[00:06:04.09] Still doing foreclosures. 
[00:06:09.10] Um, still servicing brokers in the local area. (Clears throat) 
[00:06:09.22] Essentially, uh once that started to downturn, basically I went back into construction that was right around two thousand eight when all the property values were super high. 
[00:06:22.22] Um, I had a lead on a property in Aurora that I really, really couldn't pass up so I basically I beg borrow and steeled to ah, to purchase the property and flip it.
[00:06:42.01] That property was basically, that was essentially my first personal um, endeavor is into real estate investing and so forth which it did fairly well
[00:06:52.28] Joe:  Let, well before you get too far let’s talk about it.
[00:06:56.20] What year was this? 
[00:06:57.00] Joe:  This was two thousand, well actually I brought it in the late two thousand six.
[00:07:02.14] Joe:  okay
[00:07:02.14] Tim:  Is when I, when I bought the property. (Crosstalk)
[00:07:05.23] Joe: Right before the crash
[00:07:05.23] Tim:  And then I sole it in two thousand eight.  
[00:07:07.12] Joe:   right yeah right before the crash so property values were maxed out. 
[00:07:11.08] I bought the property super cheap it was it was almost a wholesale deal. 
[00:07:16.04] Um, the guy, the listings had just expired I went and looked at the property even though it it just expired. 
[00:07:26.20] And the guy was in foreclosure, he was ready to lose the property.
[00:07:29.13]  And uh, basically I made him an offer and he accepted and we kind of did it through my realtor that was showing me the property.
[00:07:38.16] Um, so my realtor kind of double into the deal at that time because the listing expired.
[00:07:44.07] Joe:  Right. 
[00:07:44.07] Tim: So it was almost a, almost a wholesale deal. 
[00:07:47.13] I, I wrote the contract myself that time. 
 [00:07:50.05] Joe:  okay
[00:07:50.05] Tim:  Um, and so forth but uh, yeah that property, I bought it. 
[00:08:00.02] I believe it was one ninety. 
[00:08:00.28] it was on a acre unincorporated Aurora DuPage County in Illinois.
[00:08:08.03] Joe:  okay.
[00:08:08.03] Tim:   I know there are other people that are listening.
[00:08:10.08] Joe:  Sure
[00:08:10.08] Tim:  And essentially it was a really niche, um, market there. 
[00:08:16.24] There’s houses literally right across the street that were incorporated in Aurora that we're selling at like six hundred at the time. 
[00:08:24.04] Literally like, the (inaudible) these houses.
 [00:08:27.13] So this property had a lot of potential is it it was really run down but the size of the property was a twenty seven hundred square foot ranch. 
[00:08:38.21] Three bedroom two and a half bath and um, the property was really run down it had like a flat roof on the back that witch and you know. 
[00:08:50.20] You always talk about how if you could, if you could go back and do it again with people. 
[00:08:58.00] Um on your podcasts there's a lot of things that I would have done differently. 
[00:09:03.07] This property I basically built to to satisfy my own personal tastes. 
 [00:09:10.19] Joe:  Ah,
[00:09:10.19] Tim:  Which is, which in turn I spent a lot of money. 
[00:09:20.19] I did a lot of work.
[00:09:21.02] I mean when you're flipping for yourself it's a ton of work. 
[00:09:23.04] Joe:  Right
[00:09:23.04] Tim:  And, um, I did a lot of work it was a major construction. 
[00:09:27.26] I mean we completely tore off the roof. 
[00:09:33.27] Re-trusted re configured everything, it was, it was major construction. 
[00:09:35.02] And for it being my first personal flip, my timeline was blown way out of proportion. 
[00:09:43.20] Um, I had figured that it would originally taking about eight months. 
[00:09:48.09] um, it ended up taking me about a year and half. 
[00:09:49.23] Joe:  Wow!
[00:09:50.27] Tim:  Um, (crosstalk) 	
[00:09:52.22] Joe: long time 
[00:09:51.21] I actually ended up, yeah during during opening the property actually refinanced it. 
[00:09:56.14] I found a bank that would uh, refinance it at the the finish appraised value. 
[00:10:04.01] Tim:  Nice
[00:10:04.01] Joe:  Uh,  at the time, which is good because you know at that time the banks were not exactly um, how do you say? 
[00:10:14.21] The banks are not exactly dotting all their I's and crossing all their T's.
[00:10:17.03] Joe:  So this is still before the crash obviously.
[00:10:19.19] Tim: Yeah, that was still before the crash.
[00:10:21.05] Joe:  Giving away money. 
[00:10:22.01] Joe:  Right they were, they were giving away money.
[00:10:25.14] I refinanced the property.
[00:10:27.04] Got some money to finish it um, as well as lower the payment um, on the property for the next think it was like six months later the next actually sold it. 
[00:10:36.29] Um, so we brought it at like one ninety. 
[00:10:41.06] I put about eighty into it. 
[00:10:43.01] Um, I ended up selling it for three twenty. 
[00:10:45.16] Um, 
[00:10:45.21] Joe: Nice.
[00:10:45.22] Tim: So I mean, I did make some money on it. 
[00:10:50.27] I did pay some bills. 
[00:10:50.27] I did own it a long time, um, you know we paid the taxes on it for that full year. 
[00:10:56.03] Um, so, you know, we, we did okay.
[00:10:58.26] I mean, you know, it was, it is an endower.
[00:11:01.23] it was a real strain on my family. 
[00:11:04.28] It  was a real strain on me. (Laughs) 
[00:11:06.06] This, especially with trying to run a business as well as, as during the flip. 
[00:11:10.23] Joe:  Sure. 
[00:11:10.23] Tim:  Um, you know doing it and when, everything took off the two thousand eight as far as my foreclosure stuff my foreclosure business stuff, um,  I would just glad to not have that property. 
[00:11:22.29] Joe:  Right.
[00:11:23.03] Tim: Because, everything went crazy for me.
[00:11:25.12] Joe:  Now did you? 
[00:11:26.16] Did you end up selling it then before the actual like the market tumbled or did you?  
[00:11:32.19] Tim:  Yes. 
[00:11:33.23] Joe:  oh.
[00:11:33.23] Tim: 	I, I wanna say I sold it two months before the actual craziness started. 
[00:11:39.27] Joe:  Right okay. 
[00:11:40.13] Tim:  So, I mean there was at the time there was on the news and everything like that there was talks of you know this can't last. 
[00:11:48.27] Joe:  Right.
[00:11:49.03] Tim:  Bump, bump, bumb.
[00:11:49.03]  We foreshadow this coming, blah, blah, blah.
[00:11:51.21] All that stuff is coming out was getting really nervous. (Laughs) 
[00:11:54.19] So. 
[00:11:55.29] Joe:  Wow. 
[00:11:55.29] Tim: yes.
[00:11:55.29] Joe: You got pretty lucky then potentially right?
[00:11:58.02] Tim: I did yeah. 
[00:11:59.18]  I did and uh  you know it's funny because I continuously, I always check up on my stuff my old stuff and and what I've done in the past and see see what  that property’s worth today is almost four hundred.
[00:12:12.21] Joe: (inaudible) 
[00:12:12.21] Tim: So the property value went up there.
[00:12:17.00] I mean you know we went through a downturn.  
[00:12:19.01] We're coming back up a little bit now.
[00:12:19.01] Joe:  Sure
[00:12:19.01] Tim:  Uh, you know so, I think at that point I did a good job and you know I forwarded the property on their, their uh, got some inequity in it and you know it all works.
[00:12:31.14] Joe:  All right cool. 
[00:12:32.12] That was the first, that was the first flip and that was uh, like nine years ago right
[00:12:36.22] Tim:   Right.
[00:12:36.22] Joe:  Roughly. 
[00:12:39.06] Tim:  Yeah.
[00:12:39.06] Joe:  Actually ten.
[00:12:41.03] Eleven.
[00:12:41.03] Tim:   Yeah it was a while ago. (Crosstalk) 
[00:12:43.18] Joe: We're getting old.
[00:12:43.18] Tim: Seems like forever.
[00:12:44.23] Joe:  We're getting old.
[00:12:44.23] Tim:  Right. 
[00:12:44.23] Joe:  Uh, so tell me about I know that you got you focused on the foreclosure servicing you were doing which I know has a lot to do with what you know kind of how we met and what started our relationship. 
[00:12:58.02] I don't remember specifically what started it honestly but uh, obviously we started working together probably I told the audience during the intro probably five or six years ago I can't remember specifically.
[00:13:08.01] Joe:  Uh.
[00:13:08.01] Tim: Yeah, I think that's right. 
[00:13:08.22] Joe: Yeah,  and then you know,  you're you were doing a lot of contracting work in the general preservation stuff for the banks and then that kind of grew into, uh, you’re interested in getting back into flipping houses and investing in potentially investing in rentals at some point.
[00:13:26.24] Tim:  Right. 
[00:13:24.21] Joe: So,  let's talk about the last couple deals you've done which are all you know, some some of the things I want to, I  want to get out to the audience, you  know your experiences. 
[00:13:37.08] Kind of starting from scratch again as a flipper-
[00:13:40.20] Tim: Yeah, pretty much. 
[00:13:41.04] Joe:  The contractor you, you’ve got the background in the in the general contracting which I think is an advantage that a lot of obviously most people don't have. 
[00:13:48.23] But, a-
[00:13:50.19] Tim:  Right.
[00:13:51.25] Joe:  You know, let’s, talk about the last couple deals. 
[00:13:54.10] Tim:  Yeah, I think the advantage comes when you know, when you watch these shows on TV on HD TV and stuff like that, you know you've got these people that think that they can go in and flip houses and they’re paying these contractors.
[00:14:07.28] Oh, how much is it to change the water heater? 
[00:14:09.23] Oh, five thousand?
[00:14:11.11] Okay let's do it!  (Laughs)
[00:14:12.01]  You know those those people and you know I just kind of laughed at those people because you know the, the prices that they're paying for, for doing general work in general construction is outrageous on TV. 
[00:14:22.12] You know I'm sure it's inflated on TV to make it more dramatic but the you know yeah I mean you know being in the construction industry it it helped.
[00:14:32.23] You know my, my, my favorites part everybody's got their favorite part of what they do and my stuff is basic you know interior trim working and so forth. 
[00:14:45.02] And so essentially the-
[00:14:47.19] I got back into flipping and it was one of the properties that I had inspected for tennis group. 
[00:14:56.07] I cleaned it out for Tanis group.  
[00:14:57.21] I winterized it for Tanis Group.
[00:14:57.21] I cut the grass for it for Tanis Group. 
[00:15:00.08] I was the first one in the property, uh, you know, after the previous owner had left in shambles and basically walked away from the property. 
[00:15:11.05] Um, that's one of the advantages that I have um,  I get to see a lot of the properties especially the foreclosures that when the people just leave I'm the first one in there. 
[00:15:22.28] I get to assess it myself.  
[00:15:25.10] I get to say okay, there’s sixty thousand dollars’ worth of repairs needed. 
[00:15:31.04] Here’s how much I evaluate it at. 
[00:15:32.10] Every every time I go to a property (inaudible) or whatever I have to do with those properties those foreclosure properties that's what I'm doing. 
[00:15:41.26] I’m constantly looking for deals/ 
[00:15:43.18] The downside is that not a lot of the banks, um, will offer the property to an investor first. 
[00:15:47.17] Joe:  Right
[00:15:47.17] Tim:   Fannie, Freddie um, those those companies actually, first time home buyers that's that's the main goal in selling those property’s so those are those are little harder to come by. 
[00:15:58.28] But, there are still banks out there that we deal with,
7[00:16:01.16] Joe: Sure.
[00:16:01.16] Joe:  That you know, I, I can be first in line. 
[00:16:04.24] This one property, happened to be in Carpentersville. 
[00:16:10.10] Um, I was, I was first one in.
[00:16:15.01] Looking at it from the outside, you could barely see it. 
[00:16:17.02] Trees everywhere.
[00:16:17.21] Trees going through the roof and, so forth. 
[00:16:20.21] But the uh, I walked in and you know the bones were. 
[00:16:23.25] Uh, when you,   I guess when you, you  know I don't know how you do it Joe but when I originally walkthrough property I'm looking at the end game as far as what I could make the property and what I can you know eventually turn it into and how much I expect it to  sell at that point. 
[00:16:43.03] Joe:  Right.
[00:16:43.03] Tim: If I walk into a property where as I can see it as okay I can add a bedroom here I can add a bathroom here. 
[00:16:51.20] Up the value of those  things and essentially you know I'll, then I'll, once I'm done with my work for the day I'll go sit in my truck and I'll say,  okay here's a much expect renovation to be. 
[00:17:01.05] Blah, blah, blah. 
[00:17:01.18] And uh, you know I'll say, hey,   I'm really interested in this property. 
[00:17:08.06] This particular property came back the numbers worked
[00:17:12.20] So I uh, I have an investor that I'd like to call it ghost investor.
[00:17:16.29] He, happens to be a family member and he, he's always kind of you know, been pushing me in the direction. 
[00:17:33.16] Hey let's let's flip some houses let's let's do some of this, you know you're in the business let's let's see what we can do.
[00:17:35.26] Joe:  Right. 
[00:17:35.26] Tim:   So
[00:17:38.01] Joe: Right.
[00:17:38.01] Joe:  So,  that day when I rekeyed  that property I called him up and I said,  "Hey I think I've got a property, here's the status I’ll send you an email. 
[00:17:47.08] Here's what I think here's what I'm gonna do with. 
[00:17:50.02] Here's the expected amount of money I'm think I’m gonna spend. 
[00:17:52.29] Here’s the sale price. 
[00:17:53.12] Here is expected profit."
[00:17:53.12] Joe:  Right.,
[00:17:53.12] Tim:  And he said, "Hey let's do it.." 
[00:17:56.29] So when the property came on the market, I believe I was the first. 
[00:18:04.28] We were the first, first initial offer. 
[00:18:04.28] Joe:  Yep.
[00:18:04.28] Tim:  And, uh, you know, I think we got a couple other offers that raised my price a little bit more. 
[00:18:11.08] Joe:  Right. 
[00:18:11.08] Tim:  I think they went up like five thousand, some like that. 
[00:18:15.05] I think it was like a hundred twenty thousand dollar property. 
[00:18:17.01] um, and you know, there was no, there's no kitchens there's no baths, there was no light fixtures there was no hand railings,  there was no carpet there was there was nothing. 
[00:18:25.21] Uh, it was just basic basic bones house and I'd figured originally I could sell it you know closer to fifty. 
[00:18:34.26] Uh, the problem with that was that I didn't feel that the neighborhood could support the two hundred fifty dollars evaluation.

[00:18:40.05] Tim:  Um, and so essentially, I, I went back and did the numbers and you know to twenty five anywhere from two hundred to twenty five is where I came back. 
[00:18:54.00] So I basically ran the numbers backwards, figured out how much I could spend and whether or not I could do it for that price. 
[00:19:00.01] So, um my investors, we did it close on the property I think in a couple weeks. 
[00:19:10.16] It was a pretty quick closing. 
[00:19:11.03] Got the property got in there, ran into an issue with permits. 
[00:19:17.20] Uh, the property was actually in a subdivision that was like a-
[00:19:27.07] How to how you say it 
[00:19:27.07]  I don't even know what it was Joe do you remember? 
[00:19:29.06] Joe:  You mean unincorporated?
[00:19:31.02] Tim:  It was, it, a it wasn't it was. (Inaudible)  I don't remember exactly what it was it was, it wasn’t unincorporated because it had a standard address but it was, it was a subdivision in DuPage County. 
[00:19:46.11] I'm sorry, Cane County, that um, had its own ticket was annexed or something? 
[00:19:52.11] Some, something of that nature. 
[00:19:53.23] So I ran into an issue getting the permit to do all the work. 
[00:19:56.10] Um, the, the permit place Cane county basically required me to do all this testing and the property did have mold as well. 
[00:20:05.14] The basement was flooded. 
[00:20:07.22] Uh, so essentially the all the county required me to do a bunch of testing remediation and so forth. 
[00:20:13.09] Um, which, I all did.
[00:20:16.21] I did all myself and you know a lot of people believe that when you buy a property you have to have it professionally remeated. 
[00:20:22.19] And that's not always the case. 
[00:20:24.22] You can do the remediation yourself, as long as the test comes back negative you're in the clear. 
[00:20:31.11] Because essentially that puts the um, (crosstalk) (inaudible) 
[00:20:36.27] Puts the blame ion the testing company, 
[00:20:39.08] Joe:  Yeah, and like before you get to into that. 
[00:20:42.25] That’s got to be somebody who knows what they are doing to some degree.
[00:20:45.11] You have to have experience.
[00:20:45.11] Tim: Absolutely. 
[00:20:48.10] I, I do that for the banks. 
[00:20:48.20] I do that for, for so (inaudible) and it's not something I would recommend to a novice whatsoever. 
 [00:20:55.04] Joe: Right, right.
[00:20:57.01] Tim:  But you know, if you have a general knowledge if you did a little research and um, online and figured out reading some books on it and so forth. 
[00:21:10.19] You can to actually purchase the chemicals that the the big companies use to to kill that nasty stuff and um, it’s not that hard. 
[00:21:18.19] And you know if you protect yourself it's not that that dangerous. 
[00:21:20.18] Joe:  Right, right.
[00:21:21.16] Joe:  So, I did that on my own.
[00:21:27.17] Basically took almost three weeks to get the actual permit to start work, which I did not figure.
[00:21:33.25] So did all the work. 
[00:21:37.05] Put in the kitchen. 
[00:21:37.05] Couple of baths. 
[00:21:37.14] I added on a bedroom. 
[00:21:39.27] This property was a split level property, so I added a, it had a split level with the basement. 
[00:21:47.03] so I  added a bedroom into the split, the bottom split level part which made it a four bedroom two and a half baths from a three bedroom two and a half bath.
[00:21:56.29] Joe:  Right. 
[00:21:56.29] Tim:   So it is added a little bit of value there. 
[00:21:59.19] Um and essentially did it did it I think in three months. 
[00:22:04.26]  Um, 
[00:22:06.05] Joe:  Yeah.
[00:22:06.05] Tim: Start to finish and you know with all the permit issues and inspections and so forth and then we had sold within thirty days I think.
[00:22:15.04] Joe:   Yeah, I think we had a contract pretty quick. 
[00:22:17.00] Tim: Yeah is under contract pretty quick. 
[00:22:22.00] Um, that one went fairly well. 
[00:22:26.03] I think we purchased it at one ninety, we sold it at two eighteen.
[00:22:29.19] Joe: No, now, we purchase-
[00:22:32.03] Tim: No, I'm sorry not one ninety.  
[00:22:33.21] We purchased it at one nineteen. 
[00:22:33.21] Sorry. 
[00:22:35.27] Joe: I think it was lower than that. 
[00:22:35.27] Actually I think, not that we're going to argue but I thought you picked it up for like one-0-five.
[00:22:41.23] Tim:  I, I think that was my initial offer. 
[00:22:44.22] Joe:  Oh, okay. 
[00:22:44.22] Tim:  And then I think it got driven up with other, other offers. 
[00:22:48.22] Joe:  okay
[00:22:48.22] Tim:  And uh, yeah, cause you actually, you vouched for me with the bank on that one. 
[00:22:53.24] Joe:  Yeah.
[00:22:53.28] Tim:  You said this is a good buyer, so we uh, yeah we got the property at call it one twenty. 
[00:23:01.22] Joe:  Yep. 
[00:23:01.22] Tim:  And uh, I think we put forty into it. 
[00:23:05.22] All in at one sixty.
[00:23:05.22]We ended up selling it for two fifteen.
[00:23:07.28] Joe:  Yep.
[00:23:10.06] Tim: Um, which is you know, it’s fairly uncommon, you know and I will call it, I've heard you call it a unicorn before. (Laughs) 

[00:23:14.24] Joe:  That was a good deal.
[00:23:15.23] Tim:  Um, it is a good deal and you know and it it it we're blessed to have it. 
[00:23:25.02] Joe:  Yup.
[00:23:25.02] Tim: You know we we all part of that too to Tanis group and to Mister Mueller. 
[00:23:32.11] Joe:  That’s me. 
[00:23:32.11] Tim:  Yeah. 
[00:23:33.03] Joe:  I want to talk about that real quick because it's too two things that you're bringing up that I just want to reiterate. 
[00:23:38.27] One is you brought up something I think that's really important that a lot of especially since we're kind of focusing on the fact that this is like a newer you know, newer investor success stories. 
[00:23:47.15]  You,  when you look at these properties you have a vision of what can I do to take, to take this, to take this uh, to take this footprint and make it something better due to actually add value to the property besides just the rehab. 
[00:24:03.02] Like you're talking about adding bedrooms.
[00:24:06.16] Tim: Right
 [00:24:06.16] Joe:  Adding bathrooms,  I mean there are,  there are investors out there that that do that on a routine level is every part of the rehab but-
[00:24:16.00]  You were,  you were kind of walking right into the game like you know what can I do to take this this three bedroom two and a half baths and make it a four bedroom two and a half bath? 
[00:24:25.02]  Thus, adding you know another fifteen twenty grand you know approximately where the value and I think most investors when they're started they don't really think that way. 
[00:24:32.23] They’re, they're just looking at you know what can I do to to get in and out of this property quickly? 
[00:24:40.27] You know I see that.
[00:24:43.11] I see, I see I hear about other investors doing it, it seems pretty easy let’s just fix up stuff. 
[00:24:47.13] You know what what do we do minimize work and as opposed to really digging into the bones of the property and making it you know-
[00:24:54.17] Tim:  Right
[00:24:54.17] Joe: Increasing the value uh, naturally just by adding to it which I think is incredible. 
[00:25:00.23] The second part is that you brought up like working with Tanis, which I appreciate the plug. 
[00:25:07.07]  But also you know like you said I mean it's not that easy to find these banks that are, that have inventory, that are actually willing to sell to investors right out of the get go. 
[00:25:16.25] And what had happen in this situation was we're in a multiple offer and the, the asset manager for the bank which is a you know, they're a regional bank.
[00:25:24.08] It’s not a little local mom and pop bank.
[00:25:27.14] But yeah they were bigger bank.
[00:25:29.13]  They, they were faced with a (beeps) decision of what,  what do I do when I've got offers that are basically very similar to each other because we submitted all the offers.
[00:25:39.21] I mean you really weren't given an, there was no unfair advantage 
[00:25:43.00] Tim: Right, and you, you specifically submitted those offers because that's your job so-
[00:25:48.00] Joe:  Yeah. 
[00:25:48.00] Offers went in
[00:25:48.00] Tim:  It's 
[00:25:52.02] Joe: And I think I'll be honest I think we had one if remember I thought we had one that was actually a little bit higher than yours that was also a cash offer.
[00:25:59.05] But the asset manager recognize that I was representing you on the buy side 
[00:26:06.23] Tim: Right.
[00:26:06.23] Joe:  And they called me and said this is your buyer like this guy's gonna close right
[00:26:10.14] I’m like aw yeah absolutely hundred twenty percent positive he's going to close.
[00:26:13.21] And they said okay, we’re willing to take you know a little bit less money which I think literally was like five hundred bucks or something but-
[00:26:20.25] Tim:  Right.
[00:26:22.18] (crosstalk) It wasn't much.
[00:26:22.18] Joe:  We're willing to take less in order to make sure this deal closes because we're taking your word for it.
[00:26:28.15] Joe:   So the thing I want to point out to the people that are listening as a new investor is it's not so much that you need to call Joe Mueller from Tanis  Group.
[00:26:36.24] Tim:   Yeah you do.
[00:26:36.24] Joe:  Yeah, you do. (Laughs)
[00:26:38.14] You need to work with, you need to work with a broker that actually has experience in the niche that you're trying to invest in.
[00:26:46.20] So whether it's the relationships with the banks whether it's the fact that they know the sellers you know of a of a regular retail property. 
[00:26:55.05] You know those things are important because it's it's a relationship business when it comes down to it. 
[00:27:00.00]  So don't just call you know,  I've said this before but you know your second cousin who just got the real estate license six months ago who decides they want to represent flippers, probably not the best guy or gal to start out with. 
[00:27:13.23] Maybe maybe down the line once they've got a couple deals under their belt. 
[00:27:18.26] Work with somebody that's got experience in that market because they're gonna be able to help you succeed is all I wanna bring,  all I wanna bring across so.
[00:27:24.23] Tim:  It make sense. 
[00:27:25.14] Absoulty makes sense. 
[00:27:29.09]  When you know that a broker has experience experience in the in the business that you want to be in those are the people that you need to network worth with that you need to seek out, use and get their advice and take it to hear because they're the ones doing it. 
[00:27:50.14] You know the the the mom and pops that just start up, that just got their licenses so forth.
[00:27:56.09] If you want to sell with them and get them some experience and you know get on their good side and you know give a property that way, that that's one thing. 
[00:28:04.26] But buying on the properties it, it's a, it's a whole nother ball game then selling. 
[00:28:09.13] Joe:  Yep.
[00:28:10.22] Joe:  Um, you know selling these days is essentially you know you put it on a bunch of websites and MLS and you're listing all the other agents do the work essentially is, it's not-
[00:28:20.17] Joe:  Yep. 
[00:28:20.17] A hundred percent.  
[00:28:22.03] Tim.: It's, it's not rocket science these days.
[00:28:25.06] Um,
[00:28:25.06] Joe:  No it’s not. 
[00:28:25.06] No, it’s hot.
[00:28:27.15] Tim:  And, and uh, yeah. 
[00:28:30.27] Having the experience broker do the work for you.
[00:28:35.26] You know maybe they're doing CMA's for you. 
[00:28:41.09] You know, I mean I think on this one I called you up and I'm like, "Hey you know can you give me the counts for this area. 
[00:28:44.19] Joe:  Sure.
[00:28:44.27] Tim:  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:47.08] You know, and you know you did it. 
[00:28:48.29] I think, I think we did it over the phone.
[00:28:50.23] Joe:  Right.
[00:28:50.23] Tim:   And I said, hey, it's a good deal and I you know I told you I was in on it and that I get the money and it all worked out so,
[00:28:57.26] Joe:  Yep.
[00:28:58.19] Tim:  Yeah, yeah that's getting back into it um, you know after construction business slowdown that you know that helps.

 [00:29:08.12]   and you know having the relationship that we had and still do, it helped me I mean it was a huge help. 
[00:29:18.03] Cause otherwise I'd be going into it blind and that's you know, the first time. 
[00:29:24.12]  First time flippers and so forth like that you're you're basically going into a blind and having that broker that has that experiences it's worth its weight in gold. 
[00:29:34.29] That's how I consider it. 
[00:29:34.29] so0
[00:29:34.29] Joe:  I think it's even even and even on the the wholesaler side when you're working with wholesalers obviously we talk about that a lot of the podcasts and you and I kind of talk about wholesaling quite a bit. 
[00:29:45.06] I mean there's-
[00:29:46.07] Tim: um hum.
[00:29:46.07] Joe:  There's so many even last night we had a we had a meeting last night at the office we had won the meet up group meetings with Dan Clarken's group.
[00:29:53.26] I think it's called the investor
[00:29:57.04] Tim:  um hum.
[00:29:57.04] Joe:  action and accountability group. 
[00:30:00.29]  We had a couple newer people there that were talking about how they wanted the wholesale in order to kind of get started and you know once they made some money they're going to get into slipping and and and owning rental property.
[00:30:17.11] Tim: Um hum.
[00:30:17.11] Joe:  Uh, and it's interesting ta, to have those conversations because they really don't know what do you do even if they got a contract on a property at a good price.
[00:30:29.09]  You know that the next couple steps I mean it's it's not as simple as just get a property under contract in just you know, throwing  out, throwing out an email blast and hoping that it closes you know cross your fingers. 
[00:30:40.07] There’s, there's a process.
[00:30:41.29]  So again going back to the you know the relationship side of business you got to have the right contacts you got to, you got to get to know people in your market. 
[00:30:50.00] You got to deal with people that have experience. 
[00:30:53.04]  Again everyone's got to get started but you know then if if you're working with a wholesaler it doesn't necessarily have a lot of experience but maybe brought you a good opportunity,  you know consult with someone who knows what they're doing that can help you guys get through the process to get the property closed.
[00:31:05.26] Cause it's not that simple but- 
[00:31:09.13] Tim:  It's not.
[00:31:10.29] And that that relates to the to the third blip that I'm doing right now. 
[00:31:13.16] Joe:  Okay. 
[00:31:13.16] Tim:  Um, where um, this property I was working on the second flip, um, which was in Crystal Lake which was a Dan Clarton wholesale deal. 
[00:31:24.13] Joe:  Right, right. 
[00:31:25.07] Tim:  Um, the the third property basically-
[00:31:30.00] Basically fell in my lap.
[00:31:32.17] Um, my drywaller  guy that was doing the work at the second flip that I just closed on, basically came and said, "Hey, you want to buy a house down the road?" 
[00:31:42.08] My buddy's getting a divorce and they just want to unload the house. 
[00:31:47.18] Joe: Right.
[00:31:47.18] Tim:  And I was thrown into the wholesale side of the property, side of the business. 
[00:31:53.08] Um, you know, hand over foot, I mean I was, I was thrown in there thrown in the water and I basically said yeah of course I want to by a property. 
[00:32:02.12] So I went and I looked at the property and it is the situation was basically, um, the husband and wife who got divorced. 
[00:32:14.21] She was the one that was making all the money paying all the bills he was unemployed at the time.
[00:32:21.11] Essentially she left him, so he was at the house he could afford the house.
[00:32:26.02] Um, the payments on the house first electric the taxes and so forth.
[00:32:29.27] Joe:  Right.
[00:32:29.27] Tim:  Found out later that his mother on the house free and clear and  that she are originally bought it as a rental we back in like nineteen eighty five I want to say it was a really long time that she's owned this property.
[00:32:45.03] Joe:  Right.  
[00:32:45.03] Tim:  And she had left her son, she had trusted the property, entrusted the property to her son and his his wife at the time and now they got divorced and he could afford to live at the property they want to unload the property. 
[00:33:01.11] Joe:  Right. 
[00:33:01.11] Tim:   So I went there and had an initial, and initial talk with them and you know her her number was you know right about it's a three bedroom one of a half baths property that had an addition on the back that was kind of, kind of a four season but not really it was fully insulated it was a nice addition. 
[00:33:23.05] Nice wood ceiling. 
[00:33:25.09] A nice addition.
[00:33:25.09] Joe: I remember seeing it, yup. 
[00:33:27.22] Tim:  And, uh, you know she she basically came back her number was at one fifty from from all of her internet searches and she's like I want one fifty for the property.
[00:33:36.26] And I told her I couldn't do it straight up to her face I said, I can’t do it.
[00:33:41.28] You know I told my number was more around the one, and I had my initial assessment of property was this is a great rental.
[00:33:51.03] It’s ready to go.
[00:33:53.17] You know it's gonna make money for sure.
[00:33:54.18] I did, you know before I even got there others run the (inaudible) on my phone.
[00:33:58.18] Running the rental numbers, I think I even called you.
[00:34:01.11] Joe:  Yup.
[00:34:01.11] Tim: And said, hey, hey Joe.  
[00:34:04.07] Help me out with this you know, let me know what you think.
[00:34:06.12] What do you think rent's gonna be? 
[00:34:06.29] Blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:07.08] You know rental rental came back I think it was a fifteen or sixteen hundred.
[00:34:13.02] The property next door was is almost the same property and it's renting for sixteen fifty.
[00:34:17.07] Um, and so I was like, wow.
[00:34:21.20] That's, that's fairly good numbers at you know, I got to see what I can get the property for.
[00:34:26.10] Joe:  Right. 
[00:34:26.10] Tim:   So she originally came back at one fifty. 
[00:34:29.20] I basically told I can't do that.
[00:34:30.29] I was more in the one thirtyish range,
[00:34:34.05] Um, and I said you know, you know what, I here's deal.
[00:34:38.14] I said let me try to get and you know wholesaling, this is my first wholesale deal. 
[00:34:43.02] So I don't know what to do.
[00:34:44.17]  I, I'm I'm mister honest when  it  comes to the construction work to to anything you know, if (beeps) I think it's going to cost three thousand dollars to put in your kitchen that's how much I charge.
[00:34:55.14] You know, I don't
[00:34:56.27] Joe:  Right
[00:34:56.27] Tim:   I can charge than eight thousand.
[00:34:58.21] No.  
[00:35:00.12]  You know I charge three thousand and that's it.
[00:35:00.12] So, I told her I said you know, I'm at the one thirty mark, let me do this.
[00:35:07.03] I gave her Dan Cartons number and Dan if you're listening I'm sorry the deal didn't work out (Laughs) for you. 
[00:35:17.09] But, Dan came back and he offered what felt you know the property was worth it what he was willing to do on the property.
[00:35:23.13] You know it's it's two different business models um, between Dan and I about what he expected to do the property and what I expected to do with the property.
[00:35:31.12] Um, and the lady took the offer from Dan which was I believe he offered a monthly payment for ex amount of years. 
[00:35:41.03] And was going to do it as a rental or you know assign the contract to someone and, and and wholesale the property. 
[00:35:47.24] Joe: right. 
[00:35:47.28] Tim; So, um, I basically gave that to Dan.
[00:35:53.02]  Dan went there as soon as Dan left she called me back and she said well Dan was just here, will you give me one fifteen for the property.
[00:36:02.23] And I said absolutely, (Laughs) I'll be right there.  
[00:36:08.22] Joe:  Yeah that was a little bit of a tag team deal I like it. 
[00:36:11.23] Tim:  It was it was kind of a good, good cop bad cop which was not planned whatsoever. 
[00:36:16.19] Joe:  Right. 
[00:36:16.19] Tim:   We did not plan that.
[00:36:19.25]  We had talked about doing that you know to where it could work to some people's advantage but you know we we had not planned it and it just fell in our lap.
[00:36:27.18] Joe:  Sure.
[00:36:27.18] Tim:  And, you know I ended up purchasing the property. 
[00:36:33.00] Which, that property I actually, I told her I would give her one fifteen all in.
[00:36:39.02] Which I guess was a kind of an unconventional type of offer. 
[00:36:44.21] For what you say.
[00:36:46.16] Essentially she paid all the real estate taxes.
[00:36:50.27] She paid all of my closing costs.
[00:36:52.07] She played all of my, uh, she paid everything.
[00:36:56.08] I was all in at one fifteen.
[00:36:59.28] Joe: Right so you basically said like, I'm gonna give you a net sale price of one fifteen, no, nothing more any other costs that go into this transaction it's, it's come out of her pocket.
[00:37:09.00] Tim: Exactly. 
[00:37:10.03] Joe:   I love it I think that's great. 
[00:37:12.29] Tim: And,   you know I I wish real estate transaction would be more, more of that you know, straight forward kind of like you're buying a car, here's how much it cost.
[00:37:22.17] Joe:  Right.
[00:37:22.27] Tim: Um, but you know, that they always add the taxes.
[00:37:26.26] They always at the dealership fees. 
[00:37:28.01] They always add this. 
[00:37:28.21] Joe:  Sure.
[00:37:28.21] Tim:  It would be, you know it be great if you said okay here's a much I'm going to give you. 
[00:37:33.26] Either you take it or leave it.
[00:37:35.00] And that's that's what I did.
[00:37:36.13]  And she, she took it.
[00:37:37.02] She signed the contract. 
[00:37:38.14] She took the contract to her lawyer. 
[00:37:39.26] She didn't even want to see the contract.
[00:37:40.26] I took the country to our lawyer.
[00:37:42.28] Um, who was a divorce lawyer and I know how that worked in there but um.
[00:37:48.00] Joe:  Sure.
[00:37:48.08] Tim:  I guess lawyers are lawyers.
[00:37:51.13] Joe:  Lawyers are lawyers, yep.
 [00:37:53.06] Tim:  And uh, she, she looked over the contract basically called me and said, “Hey this is not a contract."
[00:37:58.15] and it was actually a contract that you forwarded me.
[00:38:01.11] Joe:  Right.
[00:38:01.11] Tim:  Um, that you use in your wholesale stuff and I said, “yes absolutely it's a contraction if she signs it, she's uh, she's bound to do it."
[00:38:09.28] And uh, we went that direction and the lawyer agreed. 
[00:38:15.04] Okay it's a contract.
[00:38:17.02] We closed on the property, I think in ten days twelve days.
[00:38:21.12] Joe:  Yeah. 
[00:38:21.12] It's pretty impressive.
[00:38:22.07] Tim:  Yeah and I guess when you've got the cash to it's a flaunting in somebody’s face, they, they jump as hard as they can.
 [00:38:31.10] Um, which, you know, I immediately called my investor.
[00:38:37.25] We immediately got going on the deal and uh, purchased the property and that one's currently under, under construction, almost done.
[00:38:43.26] Uh, and that was two months ago.
[00:38:49.26] Two months ago? 
[00:38:49.26] Joe:  Right.
[00:38:49.26] Yeah.
[00:38:50.01] Tim:  And you know this property of was originally when I walked through I originally thought it was going to be a rental.
[00:38:57.08] Um and after purchasing it at that one fifteen number and doing some more uh, comps in the area and it's actually because it went really fast, I didn't have time to sit down and really, rally look at  enough at everything.
[00:39:14.15] Which you always wanna do your due diligence. 
[00:39:16.06] You always want to do that.
[00:39:17.01] This was a very fast deal I had to like, run over there kind of scenario.
[00:39:23.02] Um, after looking at all the numbers, I felt that, that addition on the back could be made into a fourth bedroom and then I could also, because it was a three bedroom one and a half bath.
[00:39:35.13] So I basically changed it to a four bedroom two bath.
[00:39:39.02] Joe:  Right. 
[00:39:39.02] Tim:  So I added a shower to the first floor bath.
[00:39:43.05] Which is kind of awkward, um, as far as, you know having a shower on your first floor, um, because essentially all your guests are going to use the bathroom.
[00:39:54.05] But essentially I made the shower into to a super fancy shower.
[00:39:58.18] Joe:  Yup.
[00:39:59.02] Tim:  You know and and, um, so it's more of a show piece as opposed to a you know, super functional basic stand up shower.
 [00:40:08.29] It’s, it's kind of a show piece so I I think that buyers will look at it and say, “Hey that's kind of cool." 
[00:40:16.03] You know, never mind the awkwardness of having a bathroom on the first floor or a shower on your first floor.
[00:40:21.05] Joe:  Hey, now.
[00:40:21.05] Hey, now, we put a shower in my first four bathroom of my house. 
[00:40:25.25] Tim:  You did!
[00:40:25.25] Joe:  Yeah.
[00:40:25.25] Tim:  You did and it that's where, that’s where the idea came from.
[00:40:28.06] Joe:  Ah ha!
[00:40:28.25] Tim:  You know we, we did we did your shower and it's like a super fancy shower like a car wash kind of thing you know and it works.
[00:40:38.11] Joe:  Right. 
[00:40:38.11] Tim:   You know, I mean, you know you never know what you're gonna have a guest that stays over and say's hey, can I use your shower? 
[00:40:44.11] Go for it. 
[00:40:46.18] Joe:  Right.
[00:40:46.18] Tim:  Kind of thing, so um, yeah, after doing the counts and so forth you know we brought it at one fifteen, I expect to list at two forty.
[00:40:57.20] Joe:  Two forty! 
[00:40:58.14] Tim:  Probably sell it, I'm 
[00:41:00.00] Joe:  Wow!
[00:41:00.00] Tim:  Gonna list it at two forty.
[00:41:01.05] Wait, until, you haven’t' seen it.
[00:41:02.15] Joe:  I saw, I saw the before I haven't seen what you've done with it. 
[00:41:04.06] Tim: Right. 
[00:41:05.19] It’s amazing.
[00:41:07.07] Joe:  Oh yeah? 
[00:41:07.07] Tim:  Amazing.
[00:41:08.22] Yeah (crosstalk) 
[00:41:10.01] Tim:   I, I I, kind of went above and beyond (beeps)  I guess that's what I do but you know I, I don't-
[00:41:17.29] The way that I I flip properties versus the way a lot of people flip properties is I use a lot of my sweat equity. 
[00:41:25.18] A lot of it. 
[00:41:25.18] I do a lot of excess trim work.
 [00:41:29.04] I do a lot of over and above stuff that, the stuff that you see on TV but it doesn't cost me that much money.
[00:41:34.14] Joe:  Sure. 
[00:41:35.07] Tim:  Um, because I do it all myself. 
[00:41:39.01] Um, I’m a big preacher of work, work, work, you know, your rewards will be, will be earned in the end,
[00:41:47.21] Joe:  Sure.
[00:41:50.19] Tim:  Um, you know I put in all this extra work to do this stuff.
[00:41:55.01] I’m expecting to list at two forty and I expect it to sell out about two twenty five, in the end.
[00:42:00.21] Joe:  (crosstalk) okay
[00:42:00.21] Tim:  No, I always list high. 
[00:42:03.27] That's kind of part of my deal.
[00:42:05.01] I know you beat me up about it, you call me crazy and you laugh at me (Laughs) and you.
[00:42:11.26] No, you don't laugh. 
[00:42:13.18] Maybe you do, but um,
[00:42:13.18] Joe:  Maybe a little. 
7[00:42:14.13] Tim:  Um,
[00:42:14.13] Joe:  Nice. (Laughs)
[00:42:16.18] Tim:  But, I, I still with in the end don’t' I? 
[00:42:17.24] Joe:  Yeah, it's been working. 
[00:42:19.10] Tim; (crosstalk) yeah.
[00:42:19.10] Joe:  It works.
[00:42:20.00] I’m just more than mind I'm just more of a, you know and I just had this conversation with another investor last night.
[00:42:28.04] I would rather, I'd rather price it appropriately. 
[00:42:30.10] I take that back.
[00:42:31.11]  The way you do your work, it's a little bit different because you're you're doing such an improvement to the property that you know it's hard for me to see, you know we have an expectation of what the potential price could be.
[00:42:43.16] Tim:  Um hum.
[00:42:43.16] Joe:   But when you're going the rehab quality that you're putting into these properties, a lot of times it creates a challenge on you know my end to really put a hard and fast number on it.
[00:42:55.13] Tim:   Um, hum.
[00:42:55.23] Joe: And the converse side of that is, I can always tell you know when and investor list of property to high that did a bunch of shit work.
[00:43:04.26] Tim:  Right.
[00:43:04.26] Joe:   And ends up trying to put lipstick on a pig and I brought up stuff like that before.
[00:43:10.16] Where they, they, they, you know, they they don't even a lot of effort into the rehab and they just try to, you know, like I said, lipstick the pig. 
 [00:43:18.29] And in the end their priced twenty or thirty thousand higher than they should be.
[00:43:25.18] There’s no way that's going to sell at that pricing.
[00:43:26.29] Tim:  Right.
[00:43:26.29] Joe:   But your, your situation is a little different so- 
[00:43:29.02] Tim:  Yeah well the the last one that we just closed on yesterday, um,  literally had I believe it was thirty two walk throughs and multiple second walkthroughs within a thirty day period.
[00:43:42.20] Joe:  Right. 
[00:43:42.20] Tim:  So, um, I mean I guess that would kind of give you an idea of the type of property that I’m putting out.
[00:43:51.00] You know it it's a very eye appealing. 
 [00:43:52.10] So somebody sees it online, 
[00:43:54.15] Joe:  Right.
[00:43:54.15] Tim:  They go, holy cow I gotta go see that.
[00:43:57.14] And you know just getting the people to walk through is the main thing. 
[00:44:00.14] Joe:  Right.
[00:44:00.14] Tim:  We went through a lot of people, I think we got, we only got two offers. 
[00:44:05.15] We got one initial offer and then the of the offer that I accepted which was a full price offer.
[00:44:09.16] Joe:  Right. 
[00:44:09.21] Tim:  Um, which is another story.
[00:44:12.26]  Um. 
[00:44:13.27] Joe:  Well I do want ta, I kind of want to talk about this last deal just because  the inspiration for the podcast came from the fact that you just picked up a big fat check from the title company yesterday, which is what it's all about.
[00:44:24.11] Tim:  Right. 
[00:44:24.11] Joe:  So I mean, we kind of, we kind of digressed to the one you're currently finishing up so that was going to hit the market soon so that’s going to be your third rehab in the last,  what is it like last year or so? 
[00:44:33.15] Year and a half.
[00:44:34.06] Tim:  Yeah.
[00:44:36.28]: About that.
[00:44:36.28] Joe:  Okay so let's let's talk about the second one which you just closed as far as sold to an end buyer let's go over the numbers on that one and how it all kind of went down and, and then yeah, lets talk about your one eyed appraiser friend and how that works out.  (Laughs) 
[00:44:52.00] Tim:  Yeah the one eyed appraiser right. 
[00:44:52.00] Joe:  Yes. 
[00:44:52.00] Tim:  Um, on this this second property which I guess we're going backwards but-
[00:45:01.19] Joe:  That's okay. 
[00:45:02.03] Tim:  Um, the second property, uh, we picked up this was a.
[00:45:02.10] This was a deal from I believe it was, you had originally called me on it and said, "Hey you want to go check out this property?" 
[00:45:08.23] Joe: Right. 
[00:45:09.11] Tim:  And it ended up being a Dan Clarton deal. 
[00:45:15.16] Joe:  Right.
[00:45:15.16] Tim:  Where the initial owner of the property, um, her husband died a couple months back. 
[00:45:19.26]   Um, and she had actually gone into a assisted living type scenario.
[00:45:27.23] Joe:  Right.
[00:45:27.23] Tim:  She didn't have any family in the immediate area and basically gave power of attorney to one of the neighbors.
[00:45:38.11] Joe: right. 
[00:45:38.17] Tim:  Who was a CPA, which she had never done a power of attorney like that before obviously. 
[00:45:47.08] basically you and me both we met up at the property ran through it,     

[00:45:53.02] Um, came up, you know worked our numbers backwards you know figured, hey this could sell for two fortyish, you know easy. 
[00:45:58.00] You know, lower to mid, lower to mid two hundred all day long.
[00:46:05.10] Joe:  Right. 
[00:46:05.13] Tim: And you know, I think our our initial number was hey, I forgot.
[00:46:16.03] What did i pay for that one? 
[00:46:17.24] I don't remember. (Laughs) 
[00:46:17.25] Joe:  Uh, I think you paid, one fifteen for it. 
[00:46:22.28] Tim:  One I got, that’s what I was going to say. 
[00:46:25.12] Let’s say it was one fifteen.
[00:46:27.16] That was, that was with the assignment fee as well. 
[00:46:29.06] Joe:  Yep.
[00:46:29.13] Yeah, there was uh, I think like there was a seven or eight thousand dollar assignment build into that. 
[00:46:33.13] Tim:  Yep, there was, which I'm happy to pay. 
[00:46:37.07] If somebody's, somebody’s willing to find me a property and you know has a connection or you know a lot of people would would frown at that that you know eight thousand dollars off the top.
[00:46:48.07] You know that a lot people would frown at that. 
[00:46:52.12] The amount of work and effort that it takes to find these properties and, and get those properties under contract and do what you gotta do, is, it’s a lot.
[00:47:01.14] It’s a grind it's, it's a lot of hustling, it's huge work.
[00:47:04.28] Joe:  Right.
[00:47:05.12] Tim:  And I, I see the value you in it. 
[00:47:10.07] A lot of people may not, I do.
[00:47:10.07 And, if it helps me and  it may not help everyone because essentially a lot of you know a lot of flippers you know they got their contractors that they, that they use and you know they pay them a set price for X. amount.
[00:47:22.04] And they've got you know, everything runs like a robot and it's not not always a robot for everyone.
[00:47:26.29] Joe: Right
[00:47:28.08] Tim: And
[00:47:28.10] Joe: Right 
[00:47:29.08] Tim:  Um, you know, someone, someone like me if it works for me.
[00:47:32.03] Because I've got, you know the equity of being able to do the property and do all the work on the property myself.
[00:47:39.03] I’ve got that equity that I can work in there as far as you know paying eight thousand dollars up front. 
[00:47:45.15] Hey let's do it.
[00:47:48.17] The numbers work for me. 
[00:47:48.17] Joe:  Right. 
[00:47:49.11] Tim:  So, um, we got the, we got the property I think we closed on that one two weeks two I think we can close out on that one fairly quick as well, plus-
[00:47:56.20] Joe:  That just an interesting point to bring up, that was a, that was a personal connection that, uh, Dan Clarton had through one of the other neighbors I believe how he found it
[00:48:08.07] Tim: Right.
[00:48:08.07] Joe:  I believe the initial and he might be able to correct me, so I may be wrong here but, I though the initial way that it came to him was he was forwarded a link through Facebook because it was on like a Facebook garage sale, site like the Chrystal Lake garage sale site.
[00:48:30.03] And he realized or the person that send it to a new that he was you know,  that he's a wholesaler and said,  "Hey you might want to talk to this lady because they're gonna be dumping off this house and here it is on the Facebook garage sale site." 
[00:48:37.29] Tim: Um hum.
[00:48:37.29] Joe:  And that's how it worked out so that kind of interesting.
[00:48:39.02] Tim:  Yeah.
[00:48:41.00] And I think the actual the neighbor I think was also bidding on the property as well. 
[00:48:44.17] Joe:  Uh, were they? 
[00:48:46.01] Tim:  Yeah I think so, because you know, after after we got the property and he said,  he came over and talked to me and he’s like,  congratulations, blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:55.11] I couldn't see making that number work and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:48:59.07] I believe we're bedding against him.
[00:49:00.27] So, or Dan was, not me.
[00:49:03.00] But Dan was originally so-
[00:49:03.00] Joe:  Really?
[00:49:04.29] Tim:  Yeah.
[00:49:04.29] Joe:  Yeha, I don’t' know if we knew that. 
[00:49:07.20] Tim:  (Laughs) Well now you know. 
[00:49:10.26] So, um,
[00:49:10.26] Joe:  Right. 
[00:49:10.26] Tim:  But yeah. 
[00:49:12.20] You know Dan, you know, you know I see what Dan does.
[00:49:15.24] Dan goes out there and hustles and signs and phone calls and holy cow!
[00:49:23.16] I can't imagine the amount of work it is. 
[00:49:23.16] Joe:  It's a huge amount of work. 
[00:49:26.17] Tim:  So, um, that one I'd gladly paid the eight thousand dollars sign in fee.  

[00:49:33.08] Um and I knew what it was, um and, you know you've talked before on your podcast about lawyers you know going through the contracts and you know, they say, "hey, what's this eight thousand dollars for?" 
[00:49:44.18] And so forth
[00:49:44.18] Joe:  Right. 
[00:49:44.26] Tim:  You know, what not.  
[00:49:47.22] We actually got a, got a lawyer that was well versed in that type of sale and we close it in two weeks and you know, no problems and uh, we got working on it, working on it right away. 
[00:50:00.06] The property itself was a three bed room one and half bath full basement two car garage attached.
[00:50:07.01] Uh, in Chrystal Lake. 
[00:50:08.19] And, basically the lady was a book hoarder. 
[00:50:12.23] Joe:  Right.
[00:50:12.23] Tim:  She had books after books, after books after books. 
[00:50:16.15] Um, when Joe and I originally saw the property the uh, property was being cleaned out.
[00:50:23.22] You know, you walk into the basement and you could hardly walk. 
[00:50:26.21] So we couldn’t' really see everything as we'd like to but we knew what we're capable of and we knew what our end game was. 
[00:50:38.26] (beeps) and so you know, I felt like I talked to my um, my investor, made the offer, closed the deal. 
[00:50:46.09] So, we started working on the property, we got there, there were still some, uh, some stuff left which I was okay with. 
 [00:50:55.15] That's what I do for a living. 
[00:50:55.15] I clean out houses, uh, so there was still some stuff left that I agreed to uh, basically make the deal go faster instead of waiting for her to clean out all the stuff I said, "just leave it" and lets close it. 
[00:51:08.18] Uh, so I had a little bit of garbage left in there. 
[00:51:14.06] And uh, got into the property and the basement had some mold discoloration in it and um, basically it was from the lady leaving the window open because she couldn't reach the window because of all her books. 
[00:51:27.11] Um, so she had left it open at one point and uh, it was more like an easement window so it had a cover on it so rain was just kind of seeping in there.
[00:51:37.18] And there was a little bit of discoloration which I didn't originally see, which I remeated myself and tested and it's all good. 
[00:51:43.28] Um, then, um, I, I basically, what I like to do when I get into a property and I like to figure my end buyer.  
[00:51:57.14] What type of buyer I'm looking for.
 [00:52:01.05] And this particular property, this would be a high end first time buyer is what I figured. 
[00:52:06.01] Um to where (beeps) you know, they've got, they've got a significant amount of money to put down over the twenty percent and uh, they're looking for a specific type of house. 
[00:52:20.18] Um, or, I was looking for a buyer that, was, kind of an executive kind of buyer, that um, was looking for a smaller house after their kids have already gone and they're looking for a higher end house that they could relax in it.
 [00:52:38.21] So, essentially I build the property to do exactly that. 
[00:52:41.18] Um, I struggled with putting the comps, because having a three one and half in that particular area, it was one of the lower end properties. 
[00:52:54.13] Um, and not lowered end as far as the style of the house or anything like that. 
[00:52:59.28] The style's perfect, matching everything else in eh neighborhood. 
[00:53:04.05] Um, but, everything else was either four two and a half and so forth. 
[00:53:09.25] So, essentially, I struggled with the idea of putting a basement bathroom in which, you know for me to do, it would have cost me probably twenty five hundred, three thousand dollars to do.
[00:53:23.09] Um, you know breaking up concrete, putting in a stand up shower and so for the to make it a, three bedroom, two and a half. 
[00:53:35.02] And I stuffed with it because I, I had enough room in the basement but it wasn't part of my original plan. 
[00:53:41.09] Um, so I, I axed that idea and I basically went with a high end finish plan, where I did five piece Wayne’s coating in the living room, dining room, kitchen, first floor bath. 
[00:53:57.21] Um, I did a really nice wood floor. 
[00:54:02.14] Um, I did um, like in the kitchen cabinets I did a four piece crown molding and so on and so forth, like that. 
[00:54:12.08] Those types of finishes that are easy for me to do and they may be pretty pricey for the standard flipper to do, you know, to call the contractor and say, "Hey, I want five piece Wayne’s coating on these walls."
[00:54:23.15] That contractor’s goanna, you know his eyes are gonna light up with dollar signs. 
[00:54:27.01] Joe:  Right.
[00:54:27.01] Tim:  So, he uh, you know for me to do it, its' sweat equity, that's all it is. 
[00:54:32.09] Joe: Right. 
[00:54:33.21] Tim:  And uh, the hard work to do that stuff paid off in the end. 
[00:54:37.13] Uh, because I, you know, when you look at a property that has those high end finishes on a line verses just a standard flip, which there was one down the street that came up for sale two weeks before mine did.
[00:54:49.28] Joe:  Right. 
[00:54:49.28] Tim:  Uh, and was priced higher than mine but it had more bedrooms. 
[00:54:54.18] I'll give them that. 
[00:54:54.29] Um, and one more bath.
[00:54:57.05] But it was priced higher than mine which at that point I feel, I felt that it was, you know, it was priced right.
[00:55:06.02]Right around the two fifty range. 
[00:55:06.11] Joe:  Sure.
[00:55:06.11] Tim:  Um, and uh, I think we came in at two fifty- we originally priced it at two fifty five, shooting for the stars.
[00:55:11.19] Joe:  Okay. 
[00:55:12.05] Tim:  And, uh, you know after the first I think it was right at thirty days we had thirty people walk through it, um, and I lowered the price five thousand against, against, Joe Mueller's recommendation. 
[00:55:28.04] Joe:  (Laughs)
] [00:55:28.19] Tim:  And, we, we only lowered it five.
[00:55:31.15] Joe recommend ten. 
[00:55:31.27] Uh, which, my situ- my particular situation where I'm not, I don't have carrying cost like I don't, I don’t have a hard money loan on the property, 
[00:55:43.11] I don’t' have a standard loan on three property, it’s my ghost investor.
[00:55:46.03] I don’t' I don’t' have any expenses, you know, meaning you know holding it and extra couple of days or an extra month, uh, doesn't cost me as much as a standard flipper that's got loans and hard money and that type of scenario.

[00:56:00.00] So I don't mind, um and I'd rather get the price that I’m looking for then just drop it and sell it quick. 
[00:56:08.02] Joe:  Right. 
[00:56:08.27] Tim; And, uh, you know that's kind of my, and I don’t' believe I've ever told you that. 
[00:56:14.18] That’s my game plan.  
[00:56:17.21] On everything that’s my game plan, uh, get maximum value because essentially it's not costing me anything to do that. 
[00:56:24.26] So, um, so we flipped the property I think I put, we got the property at one fifteen. 
[00:56:32.23] We put, sixty into it.  
[00:56:35.24] We're all in at one seventy five, we walked away with a check yesterday for almost two twenty five. 
[00:56:40.22] Joe:  Nice. 
[00:56:40.26] Tim:  So, I guess you can call that a second unicorn. (Laughs)
[00:56:46.07] Um, if you're a,
[00:56:46.07] Joe:  Your (crosstalk) like, a you're like a unicorn breeder.
[00:56:49.14] Tim:  Keeping track. 
[00:56:49.21] I'm a unicorn magnet. 
[00:56:52.04] How about that? '
[00:56:52.05] Joe:  There you go. 
[00:56:54.25] Tim:  And, uh, no, essentially I chalk it up to the hard work. 
[00:57:00.21] And it’s not just me, it’s my family does a lot of work at the properties. 
[00:57:04.07]uh, my wife and kids actually come help me paint, um they're great painters which as soon as they hit sixteen, seventeen they're going to be looking to handouts to go play with their friends I’m gonna say, hey, let’s get the paint brushes going and lets do some painting. 
[00:57:20.23] Joe: (crosstalk) Put them on the payroll.
[00:57:20.23] Tim: And, 
[00:57:22.01] Joe:  I love it. 
[00:57:22.01] Tim:  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:57:23.11] So, you got to teach them right from the start, so, um.
[00:57:26.25] Joe:  That's a good idea. 
[00:57:26.25] I love it.
[00:57:28.00] Tim:  You know, any, any place that you can get sweat equity from or any type of method or anything that you can do on your own I'm a strong believer that, that's gonna pay off in the end. 
[00:57:38.26] And this particular property it did. 
[00:57:42.02] I'm grateful.
[00:57:43.06] Joe:  Awesome. 
[00:57:45.00] So you got yourself a nice big check today, youre going to run it over to your investor and get it deposited and hopefully uh cut some checks back and fought I’m guessing. 
[00:57:51.16] Tim:  Yep. 
[00:57:53.09] Yep.
[00:57:53.09] Joe:  Today's a good, day for Tim, we're recording a podcast to kind of go over, so uh, just kind of wrapping it up, what type of advice would you, you actually had a lot of great advice for the listener, a lot of stuff that people haven’t' said yet, which I think is awesome..
[00:58:08.02] Uh, what else do you want to add maybe to kind of bring out there to 
[00:58:14.10] Tim:  (crosstalk) Well, 
[00:58:14.10] Joe:  Some of these people that are just getting started. 
[00:58:19.01] Newer investors or maybe experienced investors. 
[00:58:17.29] Cause obviously you're, you know we call them unicorns but, these, these are deals beneath everyone’s noses.
[00:58:24.12] It's not like, this is not something that is impossible to accomplish. 
[00:58:29.24] Tim:  Right. 
[00:58:29.24] Joe:  I think that, the attitude you have is a little bit different, is you're pretty diligent on, not just accepting whatever property comes on the table.
[00:58:40.10] I mean you're pretty, you're pretty good about.
[00:58:42.16] Tim: Right. 
[00:58:42.16] Joe: You know doing your research and hunting down the right deal instead of just jumping on whatever opportunity falls in your lap. 
[00:58:47.28] So I think that-
87[00:58:47.28] Tim:  Right. 
[00:58:47.29] Joe:  I think that's a point to bring up. 
[00:58:49.12] What else do you want to add maybe so, we can kind of talk about that for a minute.
[00:58:55.01] Tim:  Um, I I guess I would, I’m a strong believer in, in the hard work, that's the main thing. 
[00:59:00.01] If, you know, it totally fries my brain that you know you see these people on TV, that go out there and they make it look like, oh we made three hundred thousand dollars on this one property in California. 
[00:59:14.29] Like, come on.  
[00:59:16.19] Joe:  (Laughs)
[00:59:16.23] Tim:  There, there's no way. 
[00:59:20.10] Unless you're doing major, major, major construction. 
[00:59:23.23] Changing the property, you know, adding huge bedrooms you know, ridiculous amount of stuff and spending a ridiculous amount of money, you're not gonna.
[00:59:36.00] it’s just, your return on youre investment is not there,
[00:59:36.00] There's no way. 
[00:59:37.13] Joe:  Right. 
[00:59:37.13] Tim:  And, um, you know you, got to do your due diligence. 
[00:59:43.08] You absolutely have to do that. 
[00:59:43.22] Um, you have to, um, you have to know your end game. 
[00:59:49.24] Um, who, you have to know who you're actually shooting for.
[00:59:53.04] Like the property in Carpentersville, I knew my buyer, I knew the buyer before I even started work. 
 [00:59:59.11] I knew the person that would buy it and that was the person that brought it. 
[01:00:04.08] I mean I knew that the person, um, would have multiple, the specific property had an extra-large driveway area with some extra cars where you could put some extra cars. 
[01:00:15.08] Joe:  Right. 
[01:00:15.08] Tim:  So, I, I structured the property towards that. 
[01:00:19.19] And by doing so, you know if you know youre markets and you know the people that you are shooting for it all ends up in the end. 
[01:00:29.05] The same thing happened with this last property that I just closed yesterday. 
[01:00:31.14] I knew the buyer would be a first time home buyer. 
[01:00:33.24] And I knew that they'd want the high end finish.
[01:00:36.05] The people came from, um, from Chicago at a high end, they were renting high end apartments, just had their first kid.
[01:00:43.25] Just out of College, first time home buyers. 
[01:00:46.14] Joe: Right.
[01:00:46.23] Tim:  They, they were looking for something you know they had more than twenty percent down. 
 [01:00:51.12] They had a, they had a great offer, and I knew it going in, that's what I was looking for.
[01:00:54.19] And it's, you know whether it takes thirty or fifty people to walk through the house you know and how many times I got to mop the floor, it doesn't matter to me.
 [01:01:04.05] That's, you know that's what you got to do to get to that end buyer. 
[01:01:08.07] The buyers are out there. 
[01:01:10.09] I mean, the market, the way the market's looking now, um, you know, to me it's looking like a sellers’ market, at this point. 
[01:01:15.27] Joe:  (crosstalk) Absoulty, absolutely. 
[01:01:16.28] It’s a sellers’ market. 
[01:01:16.28] Tim:  And, 
[01:01:18.23] Joe:  A hundred percent. 
[01:01:18.23] Tim:  Yeah, if you've got the, if you've got the properties and if you, market it as a specific property to a specific buyer and you want to keep that higher end um, evaluation oh we never even talked about the one eyed appraiser.
 [01:01:33.14] Joe: That's fine we got time, go for it. 
[01:01:35.05] Tim:  Going to the evaluation of the property. 
[01:01:38.06] Joe:  Right. 
[01:01:38.06] Tim:  The, particular property, we got a full price offer at two forty nine, nine. 
[01:01:42.08] Joe: Right.
[01:01:42.20] Tim:  Which I was ecstatic about, it’s exactly what I wanted. 
[01:01:46.07] Um, no, con- no sales contingency just a mortgage contingency. 
[01:01:51.24] And so I accepted the, accepted the offer.
[01:01:53.24] Joe:  Um hum.
[01:01:53.25] Tim:  And, um, got down, went to the inspection, the inspection was great. 
[01:01:58.27] I have a few little things to fix, um, they wanted me to add a railing in the garage for the one step, which was weird to me but. 
[01:02:06.05] Joe:  (Laughs)
[01:02:07.00] Tim:  Okay. I'll do it. 
[01:02:08.15] Um, you now, little stuff like that. 
[01:02:10.22] You know, nothing, nothing major.
[01:02:12.02] Um, so I, I agreed to eve4rythign, obviously, you know that's the best thing you can do. 
[01:02:18.06] Um, is treat youre buyers like they're, like they're kings and queens and so forth and uh, and always. 
[01:02:28.24] I'm almost always going to accept any type of repairs, cause I've gone through the property myself already, I’m going to accept any type of repairs that you want to do.
[01:02:35.27] Cause I do them myself, it’s not going to cost me that much money, I'm almost always gonna do that. 
[01:02:38.08] Joe: Right.
[01:02:39.25] Tim:  So., we did that.
[01:02:42.13] I accepted that.
[01:02:42.22] We had the appraiser walk through I met the appraiser there. 
[01:02:48.25] I actually heard Chris Davis, shout out to Chris Davis. 
[01:02:52.01] Joe:  Yep. 
[01:02:52.07] Tim:  And, uh he had mentioned in one of his podcast with you, 
[01:02:56.18] Joe:  Yep.
[01:02:56.19] Tim:  That um, hey, you should meet youre appraiser there to, to show them what uh, show them what was done.
[01:03:04.15] Joe:  Right. '
[01:03:04.15] Tim:  And an appraiser's going to walk up to a property, they don’t' care that the roof's new.
[01:03:07.25] They don’t care that the windows are new.
[01:03:09.05] Joe:  They might
[01:03:09.12] Tim:  The (crosstalk) siding's new.
[01:03:10.17] Joe:  They might not even, they don’t know that.
[01:03:12.16] Tim:  Right. 
[01:03:13.15] Joe:  I mean, it might look brand new but for all they know its two years old, five years old, I mean
[01:03:18.22] Tim:  Right. 
[01:03:18.22] They have no clue, so.
[01:03:23.01] they’re basically, they're running through these properties, um, and they're doing all their work on the computer when they get home.   

[01:03:28.02] Joe:  Right, right. 
[01:03:29.02] Tim:  You know, they're basically there to take pictures. 
[01:03:31.13]So they, they don’t' have a clue about what's new and what you did and so forth, so I met the appraiser there. 
[01:03:38.05] Where I was in the property, I was doing the repairs for the sale, putting up that little uh, hand rail and uh, the appraiser walked in and he literally had an eye patch over his one eye.
 [01:03:52.25] And, he was a big heavy set dude that had a limp.
[01:03:58.16] Joe: (Laughs) 
[01:03:58.23] Tim:  And basically walked into my property, the property had like an entry foyer thing where you step down into the main house, and he almost killed himself. 
[01:04:07.03] (Laughs) He almost, he almost lost it and, I almost lost it because, you know, if you're gonna come and evaluate my property and you know nothing against the one, eyed guy. 
[01:04:22.15] But, uh, I just want to make sure that you're gonna evaluate it properly. 
[01:04:27.13] And, uh, so I basically went through and talked to him.
[01:04:28.23] He was a nice guy.
[01:04:31.15] You know, nothing against the guy. 
[01:04:31.15] And uh, uh, I think it was like, he came on like a Friday so I had to wait for the weekend to get the appraisal back, something of that nature, like three or four days I’m waiting an finally it comes back and its short, two hundred and forty four thousand dollars. 
[01:04:46.20] Joe:  Right. 
[01:04:47.00] Tim:  And, fifty nine hundred dollars short. 
[01:04:51.19] So, I you know, in my situation, normally what I would do is I would kill the deal. 
 [01:05:00.21] Cause, it doesn't cost me any money and, I would, I would not necessarily kill the deal I would say, I would go back to the buyers and say, hey, you need to come up with this money.
[01:05:10.07] Joe:  Right.
[01:05:11.08] Tim:  Which, in a lot of cases, would kill the deal. 
[01:05:15.01] Um, which I did.  I went back to the buyers and I said, 'hey, you offered me this amount of money. I need that amount of money."
[01:05:19.26] Because, in my eyes, granted, it's not standard real estate talk and so forth, in my eyes, something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. 
 [01:05:35.03] So if you offered me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this house I believe that you should pay me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this house.
[01:05:40.04] Joe:  Sure.
[01:05:40.04] Tim:  Regardless of what someone, who walks through the property for fifteen minutes, he was literally there for fifteen minutes.
[01:05:46.09] Joe: Right. 
[01:05:47.13] Tim:  What that person, that one person out of the tens and thousands of appraisers that we have in the Chicagoland area, that one guy said it was fifty nine hundred dollars short. 
 [01:05:57.10] Joe:  Right. 
[01:05:57.11] Tim:  So, I basically went back to my buyer and I said, "Hey, you need to come up with the money." 
[01:06:02.20] And, uh, they basically came back and said, no, we can't, we've got to put a deck in the back and we want to do all this landscaping, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:06:13.11] And I said, well if you've got money to do that, you've got money to pay me.  
[01:06:17.03] Either you want the house, or you don’t. 
[01:06:19.11] Um, and then we went back and forth a couple of times and it almost killed the deal. 
[01:06:24.07] Joe:  Right. I remember.
[01:06:25.04] Tim:  Which, which, uh you know, money's money to me it doesn't hurt me to keep the property a couple extra days. 

[01:06:35.19] especially when I got thirty something people walking through it. 
[01:06:38.21] So, um went back and forth and finally I offered them, I said, 'okay, I'm not gonna do any of these other repairs" 
[01:06:44.26] Um, which the inspector found with the handrails and stuff like that I think I, I put up one hand rail and that was it. 
[01:06:52.15] And you know cause, cause I was waiting for the appraiser that day. 
[01:06:55.16] So I only did one thing.
[01:06:59.16] And uh, so I said I’m not going to do any of the other repairs which I probably valued at maybe fifteen hundred dollars.
 [01:07:05.17] You know, cut some trees back, change the GFI that wasn't working. 
[01:07:11.07] Stuff like that
[01:07:11.07] Joe:  Right.
[01:07:11.07] Tim:  Nothing major, and uh, (crosstalk) (inaudible) 
[01:07:13.24] Joe:  Simple fixes.
[01:07:13.24] Tim.  Simple fixes, so I basically went back to them and I said, "hey, I'm not gonna do any of these other repairs, take it or leave it.
[01:07:20.01] That's the deal." 
[01:07:20.01] So, they accepted that. 
[01:07:23.21] I didn't do any of the other repairs and uh, we, we sold it at two forty four and you know we made some money. 
[01:07:33.13] Joe:  Great.
[01:07:33.13] Tim:  We made some money for sure. 
[01:07:34.26] So, 
[01:07:36.04] Joe:  Yeah, it sounds like a pretty healthy deal, I mean it sounds like another unicorn, I love it. 
[01:07:40.21] Tim: um hum
[01:07:40.21] Joe:  I think I might have to change the title of the pod cast to something about uh, newer investor and (Laughs) his three, his three new unicorns.
[01:07:48.09] Joe: It's awesome. 
[01:07:50.17]   Uh,
[01:07:50.17] Tim:  Yeah.
[01:07:50.17] Joe:  So, I mean, I, I like the point you brought up I think that’s something that everyone needs to follow suit with which is, always, always, always meet your buyers appraiser at the property.
[01:08:03.17] Uh, some of the things that I've done in the past and I've heard of other investors doing is actually having proof of like sometimes the before and after as well, so if
[01:08:13.07] Tim:  Yep.
[01:08:13.07] Joe:  If you're, if you're buying a real hunk of junk uh you know filled with mold or whatever the situation is, it’s a good idea to maybe, maybe have some before pictures there as well so he gets a, conceptually can visualize literally how much work went into the property. 
[01:08:29.28] Tim: Um hum
[01:08:29.28] Joe:  Or she, um so that's a great point. 
[01:08:33.06] And be there to answer questions and advise you know what what the potential cost and value of some of the repairs is, because that's what it comes down to as well.
[01:08:43.06] If you're dumping fifty thousand into a property and that appraiser doesn’t' rally have a, have an idea of how much money really went into it, you know its' the investors job to push that information on to him.
[01:08:52.19] Tim:  Uh, hum.
[01:08:53.20] Joe:  So.
[01:08:53.20] Tim:  Right, and he, he did asked me, how much money did I invest in the property.
[01:08:57.17] Joe:  Okay. 
[01:08:57.18] Tim:  Um, when we were there, he did ask me, how much money do you think you have got into it? 
[01:09:02.17] I told him straight out, here's how much I've go into it and he wrote it down on his little note pad and,
[01:09:08.11] Joe:  Right,
[01:09:08.16] Tim:  Went about taking pictures so, 
[01:09:10.15] Joe:  Right.
[01:09:10.23] Tim:  It, it defiantly, I think it paid off a little bit, because secondly, he didn’t' even know there was, he didn't even go into the basement.
 [01:09:19.02] I said, 
[01:09:20.06] Joe:  Really? 
[01:09:20.06] Tim:  He was ready to leave and I said, "Aren't you gonna go into the basement?"
[01:09:21.18] And he, he's like, oh, there's a basement? 
[01:09:24.04] I mean, eventually he would have found it, you know.
[01:09:27.14] If he had the tax records or whatever. 
 [01:09:30.23] Um, 
[01:09:31.02] Joe:  Yeah but that's
[01:09:31.02] Tim:  You know.
[01:09:33.03] He didn’t' yeah
[01:09:33.19] And it just totally blew my mind, like, hey, there’s another door right there, you could have went down the door.
[01:09:38.14] Joe:  Wow. 
[01:09:38.21] Tim:  You know.
[01:09:39.20] He, uh, yeah. 
[01:09:41.17] I had to show him the basement, so,
[01:09:43.02] Joe:  Wow. 
[01:09:43.24] Well that's a great point.
[01:09:44.20] I mean, yes. 
[01:09:46.17] So sometimes, think about if you weren't there and he had no clue that there was a basement and he just you kw would have acted like it was obsolete, when he did his appraisal it could have knocked another twenty grand off the value, so,
[01:09:55.22] Tim: Right, right and it’s a finished basement, so you know, finished verses unfinished and you've got value there, so.
[01:10:02.16] Joe:  Absolutely.
