/**
 * ### Service Overview The IBM Watson Tone Analyzer service uses linguistic analysis to detect emotional and language tones in written text. The service can analyze tone at both the document and sentence levels. You can use the service to understand how your written communications are perceived and then to improve the tone of your communications. Businesses can use the service to learn the tone of their customers' communications and to respond to each customer appropriately, or to understand and improve their customer conversations. ### API Usage The following information provides details about using the service to analyze tone: * **The tone method:** The service offers `GET` and `POST /v3/tone` methods that use the general purpose endpoint to analyze the tone of input content. The methods accept content in JSON, plain text, or HTML format. * **The tone_chat method:** The service offers a `POST /v3/tone_chat` method that uses the customer engagement endpoint to analyze the tone of customer service and customer support conversations. The method accepts content in JSON format. * **Authentication:** You authenticate to the service by using your service credentials. You can use your credentials to authenticate via a proxy server that resides in IBM Cloud, or you can use your credentials to obtain a token and contact the service directly. See [Service credentials for Watson services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-credentials.html) and [Tokens for authentication](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-tokens.html). * **Request Logging:** By default, all Watson services log requests and their results. Data is collected only to improve the Watson services. If you do not want to share your data, set the header parameter `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` to `true` for each request. Data is collected for any request that omits this header. See [Controlling request logging for Watson services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-logging.html).   For more information about the service, see [About Tone Analyzer](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/tone-analyzer/index.html).   **Note:** Method descriptions apply to the latest version of the interface, `2017-09-21`. Where necessary, parameters and models describe differences between versions `2017-09-21` and `2016-05-19`.

     * @param {Object} options - Options for the service.
     * @param {String} options.version_date - The API version date to use with the service, in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Whenever the API is changed in a backwards incompatible way, a new minor version of the API is released. The service uses the API version for the date you specify, or the most recent version before that date. Note that you should not programmatically specify the current date at runtime, in case the API has been updated since your application's release. Instead, specify a version date that is compatible with your application, and don't change it until your application is ready for a later version.
     * @param {String} [options.url] - The base url to use when contacting the service (e.g. 'https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/tone-analyzer/api'). The base url may differ between Bluemix regions.
     * @param {String} [options.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
     * @param {String} [options.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
     * @param {Boolean} [options.use_unauthenticated] - Set to `true` to avoid including an authorization header. This option may be useful for requests that are proxied.
     * @param {Object} [options.headers] - Default headers that shall be included with every request to the service.
     * @param {Object} [options.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out] - Set to `true` to opt-out of data collection. By default, all IBM Watson services log requests and their results. Logging is done only to improve the services for future users. The logged data is not shared or made public. If you are concerned with protecting the privacy of users' personal information or otherwise do not want your requests to be logged, you can opt out of logging.

    /**
     * Analyze general purpose tone.
     *
     * Uses the general purpose endpoint to analyze the tone of your input content. The service analyzes the content for emotional and language tones. The method always analyzes the tone of the full document; by default, it also analyzes the tone of each individual sentence of the content.   You can submit no more than 128 KB of total input content and no more than 1000 individual sentences in JSON, plain text, or HTML format. The service analyzes the first 1000 sentences for document-level analysis and only the first 100 sentences for sentence-level analysis.   Use the `POST` request method to analyze larger amounts of content in any of the available formats. Use the `GET` request method to analyze smaller quantities of plain text content.   Per the JSON specification, the default character encoding for JSON content is effectively always UTF-8; per the HTTP specification, the default encoding for plain text and HTML is ISO-8859-1 (effectively, the ASCII character set). When specifying a content type of plain text or HTML, include the `charset` parameter to indicate the character encoding of the input text; for example: `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8`. For `text/html`, the service removes HTML tags and analyzes only the textual content.
     *
     * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
     * @param {ToneInput|string} params.tone_input - JSON, plain text, or HTML input that contains the content to be analyzed. For JSON input, provide an object of type `ToneInput`.
     * @param {string} params.content_type - The type of the input: application/json, text/plain, or text/html. A character encoding can be specified by including a `charset` parameter. For example, 'text/plain;charset=utf-8'.
     * @param {boolean} [params.sentences] - Indicates whether the service is to return an analysis of each individual sentence in addition to its analysis of the full document. If `true` (the default), the service returns results for each sentence.
     * @param {string[]} [params.tones] - **`2017-09-21`:** Deprecated. The service continues to accept the parameter for backward-compatibility, but the parameter no longer affects the response.   **`2016-05-19`:** A comma-separated list of tones for which the service is to return its analysis of the input; the indicated tones apply both to the full document and to individual sentences of the document. You can specify one or more of the valid values. Omit the parameter to request results for all three tones.
     * @param {string} [params.content_language] - The language of the input text for the request: English or French. Regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. The input content must match the specified language. Do not submit content that contains both languages. You can specify any combination of languages for `content_language` and `Accept-Language`. * **`2017-09-21`:** Accepts `en` or `fr`. * **`2016-05-19`:** Accepts only `en`.
     * @param {string} [params.accept_language] - The desired language of the response. For two-character arguments, regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. You can specify any combination of languages for `Content-Language` and `accept_language`.
     * @param {Function} [callback] - The callback that handles the response.
